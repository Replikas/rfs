00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.837
Honestly, Eagle Man, I didn't think you'd come out this far.

182
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.798
Way to prove me wrong. I mean...

183
00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:29.092
I'm not actually from the dimension you found me in.

184
00:08:29.093 --> 00:08:31.136
My whole family jumped together.

185
00:08:31.137 --> 00:08:33.723
And when the space version of my wife showed up,

186
00:08:33.724 --> 00:08:35.183
I thought she'd hate me...

187
00:08:35.184 --> 00:08:37.060
and she did.

188
00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:39.480
But then I turned into a bug and we all had sex.

189
00:08:39.481 --> 00:08:42.693
Eagle Man! God damn.

190
00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:46.948
I-I-I guess it is all pretty cool when I say it out loud.

191
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:49.368
Thanks for opening my eyes to that.

192
00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:51.662
I'm just you, brother.

193
00:08:51.663 --> 00:08:53.331
Welp, outta suds.

194
00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.709
And I did promise to get you home.

195
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.420
Thanks for ridin' with me.

196
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:00.464
It's the most fun I've had in a while.

197
00:09:00.465 --> 00:09:02.426
Wait, one second-- Ooh! Whoa!

198
00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:06.472
Uhp, hold on, heh, I'm a little drunk.

199
00:09:06.473 --> 00:09:08.933
If this dimension's Jerry was like me,

200
00:09:08.934 --> 00:09:11.020
he'd keep a 12-pack in the bathroom

201
00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:13.607
for the occasional shower beer.

202
00:09:13.608 --> 00:09:15.276
Eagle Man!

203
00:09:17.988 --> 00:09:20.364
These, uh-- Yeah.

204
00:09:20.365 --> 00:09:21.993
These are warm.

205
00:09:24.537 --> 00:09:27.123
Shit, shit, shit, we're cutting it close.

206
00:09:27.124 --> 00:09:30.295
Ugh, slow down. So much liquid in my stomach.

207
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.256
I'm not being contrarian,

208
00:09:33.257 --> 00:09:34.966
I-I just think it'd be gross to do that to a cat.

209
00:09:34.967 --> 00:09:36.718
Squeamish Morty.

210
00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:39.013
I'm not squeamish--

211
00:09:39.014 --> 00:09:40.681
No, no, no, shit!

212
00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:42.184
We missed the connection?

213
00:09:42.185 --> 00:09:44.019
What does that mean, what does that mean?!

214
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.356
It's all good, Jerry. We're fine.

215
00:09:46.357 --> 00:09:49.025
Look. Those guys portal into this Taco-la-Taco every week.

216
00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:50.694
There's a Gene we can stay with

217
00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:52.655
while we wait-- he's hip to the scene,

218
00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:54.866
even has a few cots in his basement-- A week from now?!

219
00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:56.743
I can't stay with some Gene for a week,

220
00:09:56.744 --> 00:09:58.454
Rick will just replace me.

221
00:09:58.455 --> 00:09:59.705
No, he won't.

222
00:09:59.706 --> 00:10:01.040
They won't even notice you've been gone.

223
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:04.086
That's not a good thing! Gah.

224
00:10:04.087 --> 00:10:06.047
There is one way, but--

225
00:10:06.048 --> 00:10:07.882
Get me home!

226
00:10:07.883 --> 00:10:11.261
Okay, but why's it out in the woods?

227
00:10:11.262 --> 00:10:13.264
You wanna get home fast, right?

228
00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:16.352
Only way to do that's through Grand Central.

229
00:10:18.313 --> 00:10:20.731
Couple parallel Mortys tried to pull a keg

230
00:10:20.732 --> 00:10:23.360
outta their Bag of Holding, turned it inside out.

231
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:27.116
Now it's kind of a... toll road.

232
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:31.620
Oh!

233
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:33.081
Hey there. I'm Eagle Man.

234
00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:34.666
Got two coming out at Burlap.

235
00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:37.043
Walkie Talkie: Copy that.

236
00:10:37.045 --> 00:10:41.508
So... were you camping, or--

237
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:42.593
Get in.

238
00:10:47.057 --> 00:10:49.268
Welcome to Grand Central.

239
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:52.980
It's, uh, not my favorite place.

240
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:55.066
Who are these bandana guys?

241
00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:58.237
Sometimes your family goes on an adventure and doesn't come back.

242
00:10:58.238 --> 00:11:00.281
The dude that runs this place,

243
00:11:00.282 --> 00:11:02.451
he collects Jerrys that get left behind.

244
00:11:02.452 --> 00:11:04.787
Come on. Boss is ready to see you.

245
00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:08.958
Uh...? Play it cool.

246
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.878
Hey, Boss! Mooch!

247
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.129
"Mooch"? It's my road name.

248
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.465
Who's this?

249
00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:15.341
Meet Eagle Man. He's cool.

250
00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.303
I rescued him from working at the mall.

251
00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:19.055
We're just looking to get on the Tundra Line.

252
00:11:19.056 --> 00:11:21.308
Fares are up, I'm afraid.

253
00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:22.809
A Rick patched that one fridge nexus.

254
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.644
We've got surge pricing.

255
00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:25.980
Right, no problem.

256
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:27.482
Whoa. I thought you didn't have a job.

257
00:11:27.483 --> 00:11:30.027
He doesn't. Get this--

258
00:11:30.028 --> 00:11:33.323
We all use the same ATM pin.

259
00:11:33.324 --> 00:11:37.161
3-8-5-2.

260
00:11:37.162 --> 00:11:39.121
That's my ATM pin!

261
00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:42.167
Mm-hmm. The road provides.

262
00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:44.628
Wait, you steal from other Jerrys?

263
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:46.672
Maybe.

264
00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:49.927
Or maybe poor, silly Jerry was just careless with his money.

265
00:11:49.928 --> 00:11:51.261
Who would believe him anyway?

266
00:11:51.262 --> 00:11:53.348
Hey! That hurts!

267
00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:55.100
You pick this guy up in the sensitive dimension?

268
00:11:55.101 --> 00:11:57.186
Search them both. Hey, fuck you, pal.

269
00:11:57.187 --> 00:11:59.355
Jerry, just relax! Well, this guy sucks!

270
00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:02.609
Seriously, Mooch. Where did you pick him up?

271
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.569
You mapping new routes and keepin' 'em to yourself?

272
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.572
Take it all. We just wanna pass through.

273
00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:08.157
You don't wanna mess with me, pal.

274
00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:10.077
My Rick could kick your ass.

275
00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:12.579
You little suburbs pussy.

276
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.917
You shouldn't need Rick-- Rick should need you.

277
00:12:15.918 --> 00:12:18.212
You just need to find his pressure points.

278
00:12:18.213 --> 00:12:19.713
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

279
00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:20.966
Take these two back to this guy's station

280
00:12:20.967 --> 00:12:22.884
and blacklist them both.

281
00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:24.052
Alright, alright! Geez!

282
00:12:24.053 --> 00:12:25.638
Hey! Get off of me!

283
00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:27.223
Hey!

284
00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:32.396
âª

285
00:12:32.397 --> 00:12:35.401
No, no, no! They cut us off!

286
00:12:37.445 --> 00:12:39.905
I can still get home, right?

287
00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:41.617
Fuck!

288
00:12:44.203 --> 00:12:47.081
Goddamnit! I told you to play it cool!

289
00:12:47.082 --> 00:12:49.835
This was all I had, man! The road was my life!

290
00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:51.962
What about my life?

291
00:12:51.963 --> 00:12:54.507
I didn't ask for any of this, you just showed up at my house!

292
00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:57.344
Okay, okay, here's my pitch-- uh, we get jobs as dock workers,

293
00:12:57.345 --> 00:12:59.180
tell them we're twins or something,

294
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:00.932
uh, save up for three months and move to Spain.

295
00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:03.310
We'll open a dance studio-- start small,

296
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:04.979
but eventually-- I'm not doing any of that!

297
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.899
Where even are we?!

298
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.359
Morty's high school?

299
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.906
Yeah. This used to be my dimension.

300
00:13:12.907 --> 00:13:15.909
The shed was my way out. Oh, screw this.

301
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.120
Hey! Where are you going? To our house!

302
00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:20.122
There's gotta be an exit somewhere!

303
00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:23.585
Bad idea. T-T-There is no house. You expect me to trust you?!

304
00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:25.504
What was I thinking?!

305
00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:27.131
That I'd become some sort of hillbilly road-sage?

306
00:13:27.132 --> 00:13:29.176
A cool prospector?

307
00:13:29.177 --> 00:13:32.512
My family loves me and I threw it away-- for this?

308
00:13:32.513 --> 00:13:34.599
Stupid, Jerry. Stupid! No, wait!

309
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.601
I-I left my dimension because I felt unappreciated

310
00:13:36.602 --> 00:13:40.773
and by the time I found my way back, Beth had remarried!

311
00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:42.317
Oh, my God. Yeah.

312
00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:44.946
This whole time you've been preaching about freedom

313
00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:46.864
and gettin' out there.

314
00:13:46.865 --> 00:13:49.201
But you're not brave. You have to live like this.

315
00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:51.578
You're the least cool version of me I've ever met.

316
00:13:51.579 --> 00:13:53.790
You're right, you're right, I'm a loser.

317
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.710
Let's just do anything other than face my family, please?

318
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.882
Hello? Oh, my God, Jerry!

319
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:02.425
And there's two of you!

320
00:14:02.426 --> 00:14:04.427
Hi, there, Paul Fleischman, CPA.

321
00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:06.847
Hi. I'm Jerry. It's a pleasure.

322
00:14:06.848 --> 00:14:09.101
Beth! Jerry's back!

323
00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:10.519
And another one!

324
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.187
Come on in. Can I get you guys some coffee?

325
00:14:12.188 --> 00:14:14.440
I'm a tea guy myself. Earl Grey, little milk.

326
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:16.526
- Morty: Dad? - Summer: Oh, my God! - Beth: Jerry?

327
00:14:16.527 --> 00:14:18.613
Hi... family.

328
00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:22.617
Rick: What the fuck is going on?

329
00:14:22.618 --> 00:14:26.664
You walked out on us to dumpster dive across the multiverse?

330
00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.457
You resented me!

331
00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:30.752
T-The kids didn't respect me, Rick hates me,

332
00:14:30.753 --> 00:14:33.423
how long did it take before you even noticed I was gone?

333
00:14:33.424 --> 00:14:35.800
Oh, we noticed, asshole! Don't put that on us.

334
00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:38.429
Yeah, maybe do something worthy of our respect.

335
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.681
Like not disappearing. Good point, Morty.

336
00:14:40.682 --> 00:14:43.310
Oh, now Rick has thoughts on abandonment?

337
00:14:43.311 --> 00:14:45.479
I just said "good point." I'm glad you left.

338
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.606
Coming here was a bad idea.

339
00:14:47.607 --> 00:14:50.360
Hey. Stop disappearing for once!

340
00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:52.279
Mooch loves you guys.

341
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.032
You're all he talks about out there.

342
00:14:54.033 --> 00:14:56.659
Morty, you love to eat bugs... Sure do!

343
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.330
...and Summer, you hate showering.

344
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.125
Not as much anymore, I've actually been working on it.

345
00:15:02.126 --> 00:15:03.501
Aw, honey!

346
00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:07.423
It's true. I miss you guys so much.

347
00:15:07.424 --> 00:15:09.926
I mean, after wandering around a bit, I did come back.

348
00:15:09.927 --> 00:15:11.011
But Beth had met Paul

349
00:15:11.012 --> 00:15:13.681
and you all seemed so happy.

350
00:15:13.682 --> 00:15:15.183
We are happy.

351
00:15:15.184 --> 00:15:16.977
But that doesn't mean we hate you.

352
00:15:16.978 --> 00:15:18.979
I mean, we hate you a little bit.

353
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.564
Yeah, P-Paul's pretty cool.

354
00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:22.817
I-I don't wanna say we "won the breakup" but--

355
00:15:22.818 --> 00:15:26.238
Guys, don't pile on! Jerry's trying to apologize!
