1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.840
- Mom! We're gonna miss the movie! - No, we're not.

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.420
Okay, but we've been here for hours.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.842
I-I don't want to hang out at the stupid horse hospital.

4
00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:10.263
This stupid horse hospital puts dinner on your table.

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.190
It wouldn't kill you to take an interest.

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.740
W-What's this thing? I-In the middle of the room?

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.999
With... With the hole in the end?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.480
That's a breeding mount. The nurses use it to collect...

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.220
reproductive material.

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.060
Okay, let's go see this latest piece of Marvel shit

11
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.099
you kids are [BLEEP] over.

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.020
Yeah. A-About time.

13
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.320
So, d-does your hospital ever need, like,

14
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.990
after-school volunteers?

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.300
Wow. Who are you and where did you put my son?

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.560
Ha! No, no. Seriously.

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.884
I-I'm very interested in... in your work.

18
00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:51.304
_

19
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.540
Morty, you dirty little doggy.

20
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.729
Ugh! Come on!

21
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.880
_

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.500
- Hey, Rick. - Oh, hey, kiddo.

23
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.440
- How's your Saturday? - You know, super chill.

24
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.780
- W-W-Whatcha doin'? - Eh, nothing adventurous.

25
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.139
You know that race of Underground Dwelling Cannibal Horse People

26
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.149
that we're always fighting?

27
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.070
Yeah, the CHUDs. W-W-What about 'em?

28
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.480
Well, don't tell anybody, but I'm working on a bioweapon

29
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.800
to use against them, so I got this barrel of horse semen

30
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.140
from your mom's hospital and I'm just gonna, you know,

31
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.600
subject it to some otherworldly forces.

32
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.949
Guess I should test it, make sure it's...

33
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310
- Make sure it's what?! - Horse semen, obviously.

34
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.919
Okay, but it says it is right on the barrel!

35
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.479
You're not being very scientific, Morty.

36
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.740
Measure twice, cut once. Especially with semen.

37
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.499
Did you even ask Mom if you could have this?!

38
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.780
Morty, if I wanted to steal horse semen, I'd...

39
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.940
Yes, I asked her.

40
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.220
What is at stake for you here?

41
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.220
- Why don't you trust labels?! - All right! Fine! I won't test it!

42
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
God damn. Your generation really picks random hills to die on.

43
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.600
Don't get too close. I'm running an inhuman amount of power

44
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.139
through this semen. Should be safe, though,

45
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.948
since the semen itself is, you know, also inhuman.

46
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.969
Here we go.

47
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.730
- W-What happened?! - The sperm, Morty!

48
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.450
They're super monster sperm now!

49
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.570
I blame myself.

50
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.819
Unless there was something about the sperm I didn't know.

51
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.409
Are you... Are you saying that to mess with me?

52
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.724
What? Mess with you how?

53
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.109
Like, trying to get me to say something?

54
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.200
Morty, I have no idea

55
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.561
- what you're talking about! - For real?

56
00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:23.579
- Yes! - Okay. Good.

57
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.990
Then... Then it's your fault!

58
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.170
- Dad, what the hell is going on?! - Beth,

59
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.469
sweetheart, can you give me a minute?

60
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.750
I'm trying to steer around the bodies of our neighbors.

61
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.049
Oh, that felt like Gene.

62
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.609
- That's on you, Beth. - Dad, I swear...

63
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.279
Mom, it's... it's not Rick's fault, it's...

64
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.910
- Space Sperm. - What?!

65
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.139
Yeah. Space Sperm. I-I've seen 'em before,

66
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.840
- but n-n-never like this. - Space Sperm?!

67
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.230
Sperm from Space?

68
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.190
Very impressive verbal forensic work, Jerry.

69
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.270
Holy [BLEEP]. How big are space [BLEEP]?

70
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.860
Don't answer that! Damn, they must be huge.

71
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.210
Oh!

72
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.046
Oh, [BLEEP], oh, [BLEEP], [BLEEP].

73
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.590
Mr. Sanchez!

74
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.960
The President is very eager to speak with you!

75
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.920
Morty, look, you gotta do me a solid here.

76
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.049
Y-you want me to keep the secret of where these things came from?

77
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.150
Yes, technically, it's a lie, but I messed up,

78
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.500
and I'm embarrassed 'cause it's, you know, science.

79
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.550
No problem. I got your back, dawg.

80
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.040
Really? Okay. Cool. And thanks, Morty.

81
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.279
I thought that'd be a harder sell.

82
00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.550
Y-You did a shameful thing.

83
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.900
Dwelling on it isn't gonna help, you know, am I right?

84
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.700
Sometimes you just gotta wipe it off,

85
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.220
toss it in the trash, and head back to study hall.

86
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.640
Uh, not getting the metaphor,

87
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.543
- but I'll take your hall pass. - Sanchez!

88
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.753
Get the hell in here!

89
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.546
Space Sperm?

90
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.280
- Jesus, how big are space [BLEEP]? - Same page club.

91
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.650
Well, Mr. President, the theory of Cosmic DNA

92
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.928
has been around for decades...

93
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.170
Chupacabras, Yeti,

94
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.850
Stonehenge, Ancient Rome.

95
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.310
Are these all myths, monsters, legends,

96
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.930
or different names for sperm from outer space?

97
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.229
I'll tell you what I think, Sanchez.

98
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.900
I think either you caused this mess,

99
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.219
or it's those godforsaken Horse People that dwell underground.

100
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.229
- CHUDs. - That's them.

101
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.130
Ugh, if they're behind this, so help me, God.

102
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.280
Morty, you've always been a straight shooter.

103
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.720
You can't prove that! Wait, what?

104
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.850
- Oh... oh. Right. - I can protect you, little man.

105
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.370
Blow that whistle. Toot, toot.

106
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.830
Is this your grandpa's fault?

107
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.970
Here's what I know, sir.

108
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.620
This is the greatest country on Earth.

109
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.570
It invented apple pies and lasers.

110
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.320
- Mm. Keep talking. - And that sperm...

111
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.878
We don't know nothin' about it.

112
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.989
Then the CHUDs just got themselves a war.

113
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.450
And you just dodged a personal drone strike.

114
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.000
Hello! Hello. Sorry, I'm late.

115
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.790
This is Professor Shabooboo, the world's leading expert on sperm.

116
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.089
- Thanks for getting here so fast. - My schedule was wide open.

117
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.810
I have been tracking our new sperm friends since their arrival,

118
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.890
a-and if my calculations are correct,

119
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.479
they have gathered here.

120
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.420
Why would the sperm go to the Grand Canyon?

121
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.860
Why are you looking at me like the answer is obvious?

122
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.430
Oh, you can't be serious. Are we in middle school?

123
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.370
You think sperm are instinctively heading

124
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.809
- for America's... - Don't high-road us, lady.

125
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.320
It's where they went.

126
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.649
Now, how do we deal with these...

127
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.190
"Orgasogoblins"? No takers?

128
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.440
Okay. These... "[BLEEP]plestiltskins?"

129
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.930
No? Dumb? These, uh, "[BLEEP] Boogins?"

130
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.199
Oh, yeah, yeah, [BLEEP] Boogins.

131
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.750
Really? [BLEEP] Boogins?

132
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.519
We'll use it as a placeholder and beat it later.

133
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.090
Mr. President, i-if I may?

134
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.310
Luckily, I was able to secure a specimen.

135
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.999
Now, obviously our first steps will be to analyze its DNA

136
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.130
and figure out what these beautiful creat...

137
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.590
- Oh, why?! - It-it had a gun!

138
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.290
Are you out of your mind bringing an armed sperm in here?

139
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.530
But they can't hold guns!

140
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.260
The boy literally never lies!

141
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.780
Look, if you want these things gone,

142
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.720
give Rick and me a plane and some nukes.

143
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.529
We'll wipe 'em out and leave no trace of them.

144
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.169
- Only one way to deal with it. - He's right.

145
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.190
I'm a scientist.

146
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.430
Fair enough. Blow 'em to hell. What are people gonna do,

147
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.190
complain we made the canyon grander?

148
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.750
Jerry, we're being bad parents. Do something!

149
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.375
- I-is this water for everyone? - Yes, and I'd love a glass.

150
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.870
Comin' up!

151
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.710
What are you doing?

152
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.190
And, Rick, to make sure you don't screw anything up,

153
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.790
I'm sending my best men with you.

154
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.660
- And women. - It's a fine suggestion,

155
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.630
but I doubt their leader will be a sexy queen

156
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.960
that needs to be kickboxed.

157
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.130
100% male Marines!

158
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.100
They say cutting a sperm's throat

159
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.350
is like running a warm knife through butter.

160
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.950
I'm gonna make these things pregnant... with death!

161
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.530
- No fear! - No humility!

162
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.693
Zero chance of consequences!

163
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.439
Hey, gentlemen's bet... which of these background Marines

164
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.629
you think will last the longest?

165
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.340
I'm not betting on human lives, Rick.

166
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.940
All of these people are gonna survive,

167
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.810
but obviously that guy the longest.

168
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.030
Yeah, he's my pick, too.

169
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.850
What's his name? Blazen?

170
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.530
- Pretty cool. - Yeah. He's, like, meditating through turbulence.

171
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.790
Psh. I bet if something fell,

172
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.329
he'd like, catch it without opening his eyes.

173
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.949
- Totally. - Should we throw something at him?

174
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.089
I-I got a pencil somewhere.

175
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.552
Who-who's shooting at us?!

176
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.270
Oh, wow, that's unexpected.

177
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.020
The sperm made a catapult?!

178
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.550
A-A-Are they getting smarter?!

179
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.690
No, you're getting dumber because that's a trebuchet.

180
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.105
Nobody knows the difference!

181
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.970
They're reloading that textbook trebuchet!

182
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.194
- Time to fly! - Aaaaaah! Oh!

183
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.340
We gotta keep moving.

184
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.489
- So cool. - Not even a scratch.

185
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.810
Okay, girls, and I mean that derogatorily.

186
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.750
We just took a fat "L," and what we need is a fat "P."

187
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.750
A plan. I take the lead here. You two watch the flanks.

188
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.660
Blazen, bring up the... Hey!

189
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.040
Please, one person draws the plan! [BLEEP]!

190
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.263
- [BLEEP]! - [BLEEP]!

191
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.690
I'm sorry, but what the hell are we calling them?

192
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.290
Agh! Oof.

193
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.850
Fine. I'm dying, so I get to pick the name.

194
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.950
Crispy Cremes with a "C"!

195
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.910
Whoa!

196
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.488
Whoa. E-Easy there, little guy. It's okay.

197
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.824
I-I-It's okay.

198
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.990
Do you... recognize me?

199
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.820
Do you know you came from me?

200
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.170
I'm Morty.

201
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.560
I'll call ya "Sticky,"

202
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.880
'c-'cause you're sticky and... and you're stuck.

203
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.250
Oh.

204
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.650
- Step aside, Morty. - It's okay.

205
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.800
Y-You don't gotta do this.

206
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.700
It's haploid genetic code, Morty,

207
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.510
a biological fertilizing machine.

208
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.680
W-What's gotten into you?

209
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.931
Rick, let him go.

210
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.433
Ugh.

211
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.840
Morty, don't [BLEEP] with me.

212
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.129
What the hell's going on with you?

213
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.680
I think I know exactly what's going on here.

214
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.850
Kidding. This shit is totally random.

215
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.028
- Let's keep moving. - W-Which way?

216
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.710
When one sense is bound, the others are released.

217
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.690
Holy [BLEEP]. He... He can smell caves?

218
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.029
I'm not trying to smell anything.

219
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.791
The whole planet's a dorm room trash can.

220
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.050
Sir, Rick Sanchez has gone dark.

221
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.520
I knew we couldn't rely on him!

222
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.962
Well, maybe the pilot got too horny

223
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.839
as they approached America's Vagina.

224
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.959
If you're gonna hang out in my war room,

225
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.630
you can't just make snarky comments.

226
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.410
At least do something useful, like Jerry.

227
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.190
Right to the top, just the way you like it.

228
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.380
Here's our situation.

229
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.540
Rick's gone, and so are all our nukes.

230
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.970
Now what?

231
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.720
- None of you have an idea? - I do.

232
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.355
That's right, me... the girl.

233
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.540
Gentlemen, what do sperm want?

234
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.710
The same thing as a lumberjack in the morning

235
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.890
or a fox at night.

236
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.890
- Pants! Pancakes! - Eggs. Eggs.

237
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.500
You want to control giant sperm, you need a giant egg.

238
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.819
W-W-Wait a minute. Wait... wait a minute.

239
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.860
Sperm are hunters. And what do sperm hunt?

240
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.910
- Eggs. - Exactly.

241
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.550
And what would happen if we enlarged one?

242
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.820
They'll head right for it! Get MIT on the phone.

243
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.990
And get this guy a Nobel Prize.

244
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.080
You became a woman today.

245
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.050
So, Blazen, you got kids?

246
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.920
The battlefield is my family.

247
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.090
- So cool. - Wicked badass.

248
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.430
Go. I'll hold 'em off.

249
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.880
Blazen, you don't have to do this.

250
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.620
- Shh. It is my destiny. - He's right, Morty.

251
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.730
It's the price of being Blazen. Let him do his thing.

252
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.020
Blood for blood.

253
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.610
Cream for cream.

254
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.440
Oh, no. I can't reach that!

255
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.640
Idiot!

256
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.900
What?! They're comfortable! You should try them!

257
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.030
Eh, ah! Ohhhh.

258
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.430
That'll do it. I'm worm food.

259
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.210
Morty, find my wife.

260
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.650
Tell her I wasn't wearing her thong.

261
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.859
That's a photocopy of "Sports Illustrated"

262
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.250
swimsuit model Kathy Ireland.

263
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.420
It's... it's my wife. We have sex.

264
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.210
Here, hold that picture up so we can have sex one last time.

265
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.750
I-I know how to [BLEEP] myself.

266
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.960
What?!

267
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.659
Ugh, I was so wrong about this guy.

268
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.140
He didn't even buy us any time.

269
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.440
Morty, get ready for some fireworks.

270
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.140
Ugh!

271
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.250
- Uh-oh. - Oh, gross!

272
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.980
This is the first time I've ever regretted being taken alive.

273
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.209
Wait, who the [BLEEP] is that?!

274
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.510
Silence in the presence of me.

275
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.997
I am The Sperm Queen,

276
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.730
and you are of special interest to me.

277
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.740
Hey, what the [BLEEP] are you doing with my stuff?

278
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.750
A-And why do you have the horse jerkoff machine

279
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.040
from my daughter's hospital?

280
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.330
We need it to create our army.

281
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.780
Well, you need more than that, dummy. You need a horse.

282
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.180
Oh, but our stallion is already here.

283
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.500
Isn't that right, Morty?

284
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.300
Or shall I say... Father?

285
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.950
Morty, you nasty, lying, little world-ending pervert.

286
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.180
I-I-I'm sorry.

287
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.130
What was it like?

288
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.380
Fantastic!

289
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.730
Rick, I'm sorry!

290
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.821
I-I just thought maybe I could have repeated sex

291
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.010
with a horse machine without it becoming Armageddon.

292
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.404
I-I realize that's on me.

293
00:11:38.405 --> 00:11:40.160
Yeah, not exactly accepting apologies

294
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.010
while I'm stuck here as Handjob Solo.

295
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.320
This is all your fault for being ashamed of us, Morty.

296
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.880
How many millions went to their graves for you,

297
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.080
hurling themselves into the void,

298
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.460
only to discover a grody sock

299
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.730
or a carefully folded landing strip of toilet paper?

300
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.789
How do you know all this?!

301
00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.030
Oh, honey, because we're the very essence of you.

302
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.120
We are your shame incarnate.

303
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.850
And once we're through with you,

304
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.860
our sperm army will take over the world!

305
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.860
Put him on the machine!

306
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.524
- Rick, do something! - On it.

307
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.990
- Wh-what did you do? - I got out of your eyeline.

308
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.156
Oh, no. Oh!

309
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.750
- Oh! - Yes! The end is near!

310
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.730
- Any last words? - Ohhh!

311
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.550
Sticky!

312
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.750
Gross. I know you're not a wordsmith, Morty, but...

313
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.793
No, no, no, my-my sperm friend is here!

314
00:12:30.794 --> 00:12:32.129
Ugh, never give 'em a name.

315
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.500
Fools! You can't beat me!

316
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.950
You didn't bring a woman that can kickbox!

317
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.309
Is that all you got?

318
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.020
Damn, that's some quintessential underdog shit.

319
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.316
Kill them!

320
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.550
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

321
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.440
I-I should've told you the truth, Rick.

322
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.650
Let's save the world first. Now, reset those nukes,

323
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.870
and let's turn this canyon into a can't-yon.

324
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.650
There usually earthquakes in Arizona?

325
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.090
They're heading for Vegas,

326
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.055
which does track on many levels, but why now?

327
00:13:24.056 --> 00:13:25.140
What the?

328
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.430
Let's hear it for Professor Shabooboo

329
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.600
- and his brilliant egg. - Um, hello?

330
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.620
- Aren't you forgetting someone? - Oh, good point.

331
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.450
Big thanks to the cast of Cirque Du Soleil's "Zumanity"

332
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.680
for the impressive and erotic routine.

333
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.640
Mr. President, Rick Sanchez is on the line.

334
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.460
Good. Put that asshole on speaker.

335
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.780
Well, well, well.

336
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.990
No thanks to you, we're luring the sperm

337
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.320
with a giant human egg,

338
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.699
even though, symbolically speaking, Vegas should be enough.

339
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.729
A human egg?

340
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:49.749
Where-where-where did you get it?

341
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.300
Glad you asked. It's your granddaughter's,

342
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.170
so at least you contributed something to this.

343
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.820
Mister President! It's Morty!

344
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.260
It's my sperm! I-It's all mine!

345
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.250
- What?! - I'm a dirty little perverted maniac.

346
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.840
I spent a week pleasuring myself with animal equipment,

347
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.080
and my sperm got turned into monsters on accident

348
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.440
because I kept lying about it because I was ashamed!

349
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.200
You should be! My God, man, we were all 14 once,

350
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.720
but it's called self-control.

351
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.380
Don't let them reach my sister's egg, Mr. President!

352
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.731
You'll be making a giant...

353
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.360
Incest baby.

354
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.778
What? Who told you that?

355
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.480
What? I-I was finishing his sentence.

356
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.400
Oh. Right. Come with us.

357
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.760
The sperm is Morty's!

358
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.780
We're about to make a giant incest baby!

359
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.380
Aw, well, now we're all in our darkest hour.

360
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.780
Launch the egg! Launch it now!

361
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.010
- B-But that'll take 30 minutes. - What?! Why?!

362
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.250
That's how long every space launch takes!

363
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.000
No one realizes because they only show you the last 10 seconds!

364
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.000
Uh, uh, help me out here.

365
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.330
Hey, it was your idea, right?

366
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.990
Okay, okay, n-no need to panic, everyone.

367
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.870
I have a simple solution.

368
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.220
See you all in hell!

369
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.449
I don't see how that's going to help.

370
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.060
Form a perimeter! Protect that egg at all costs!

371
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.775
I always knew your hormones would cause a world war

372
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.040
between humans and Cannibalistic Horse People.

373
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.880
I just didn't know it would be like this.

374
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.989
I can't change my nature.

375
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.220
What are you, a scorpion in a Navajo fable?

376
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.140
Everyone can change their nature, Morty.

377
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.580
It's what defines our species.

378
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.330
Look at Iron Man. That actor was an animal in the '90s,

379
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.990
literally waking up in bushes.

380
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.120
His agent had to catch him

381
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.002
- with a butterfly net. - Silence!

382
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.410
Rick Sanchez, you know why you're here.

383
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.639
Yeah, it was my grandson's fault.

384
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.290
You slept with my daughter!

385
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.140
I did? Oh, [BLEEP], I did.

386
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.000
Forgive me, Your CHUDness.

387
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.550
I'm a changed man starting now.

388
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.510
You come to the Kingdom of CHUDs for forgiveness?

389
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.810
CHUDs don't forgive humans.

390
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.640
CHUDs eat humans!

391
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.180
This is out there, even for us.

392
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.350
They can hear you, Morty.

393
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.310
Boil him up! Yum, yum!

394
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.310
Spice him right! Oh, boy!

395
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.360
Eat the flesh! Yum, yum!

396
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.470
Not the bones! Oh, no!

397
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.230
Belly ache! Ouch, Ouch!

398
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.690
Father!

399
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.820
Stop this at once!

400
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.150
Princess PoÃ±eta!

401
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.810
You can't kill RÃ­cko!

402
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.240
I... I love him!

403
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.330
Right! I-I love you, too, Princess PoÃ±eta.

404
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.990
This love is forbidden.

405
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.510
My daughter, you are a CHUD.

406
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.341
Rick is a human and age-inappropriate.

407
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.210
Then you leave me no choice.

408
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.980
By the 17th Article of the CHUD-stitution,

409
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.990
I offer RÃ­cko Sanchez horsemunity

410
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and demand a equestri-truce

411
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.354
between all CHUDs and humans!

412
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.010
On what grounds?

413
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.520
On the grounds that RÃ­cko is the father of my child.

414
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.630
I have an heir.

415
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.560
I have a substance-abuse problem.

416
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.670
The Prophecy has come true!

417
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.989
Also, did someone drop a scroll?

418
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.820
Here we go. Over here. Sorry.

419
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.120
Where did you get all that?

420
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.160
It's Vegas.

421
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.549
Sir! The Strip has been evacuated,

422
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.379
but I'm worried we won't be able to hold the perimeter.

423
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.679
Then deputize Las Vegas regulars.

424
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.500
- Everyone's a patriot today. - Even me!

425
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.259
Take three steps back, Amazing Johnathan.

426
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.689
Men and their guns.

427
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.710
- Metaphorical and not. - Tell me about it.

428
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.920
Get ready, boys! The last thing this world needs

429
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.380
is a giant incest baby.

430
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.380
Oorah! Here they come!

431
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.396
- Nice! - Do not let a single sperm

432
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.700
get through to that egg!

433
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.610
Um, should we be concerned about that scary bomb-laden one?

434
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.020
Honey, let the men handle this.

435
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.690
I think we know a thing or two about...

436
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.950
Ugh! Ready for all the responsibility

437
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.210
with none of the credit?

438
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.280
Let's Nancy Reagan this bitch.

439
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.584
Ah!

440
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.320
Dammit! We can't stop them.

441
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.560
We don't have the manpower!

442
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.933
What about horsepower?

443
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.140
Sweet Lady Liberty.

444
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.960
That sonofamare Rick has ended

445
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.523
our centuries-long war with the CHUDs.

446
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.770
- We made peace with the CHUDs! - The CHUDs are our buds!

447
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.660
RÃ­cko! The hoofless... they need us!

448
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.980
Let's do this. CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho!

449
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.990
CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho!

450
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.910
Mom, I promise to use condoms, even when it's butt stuff.

451
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.540
Okay, we have a lot to talk about tonight.

452
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.220
Is this your heart?

453
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.720
It's a play on, "Is this your card?"

454
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.740
You don't have a heart,

455
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.539
uh, but this is probably some kind of organelle,

456
00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.180
in charge of pumping endoplasmic reticulum

457
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.760
throughout your membrane and therefore,

458
00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.760
relative to you, functions as a heart.

459
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.620
So, I ask you again, is this your heart?

460
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.030
Morty, look!

461
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.210
I won't just be thrown away, Rick!

462
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.290
The egg is mine!

463
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.160
Sticky! It's all you, bud!

464
00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.920
Noooo!

465
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.223
Sticky!

466
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.851
[BLEEP]!

467
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.740
- We got a heartbeat. - Screw that!

468
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.659
That's a human life, and this is an election cycle.

469
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.430
- You have to do something! - Nope.

470
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.810
It's space's problem now.

471
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.700
Oh, this sucks.

472
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.980
You're "Sports Illustrated"'s Kathy Ireland.

473
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.190
You were with my husband, Blazen, when he died.

474
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.840
Please tell me... was he wearing my thong?

475
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.630
He probably told you not to tell me.

476
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.630
He was ashamed of it, but he didn't need to be.

477
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.850
I hope he was wearing it.

478
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.440
Always be honest.

479
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.050
Sometimes it will hurt people.

480
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.500
Sometimes it will help. But always be honest.

481
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.230
Huh. Yeah, yeah, he... he was wearing it.

482
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.890
Ew! That gross animal pig!

483
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.930
So, trying to boil this all down,

484
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.330
I-I want to say it's import...

485
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.749
Shut up, Morty, I got my own epilogue.

486
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.360
Oh, RÃ­cko, I love you.

487
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.570
Prove it.

488
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.780
Oh, I love kissing those big ol' horse teeth.

489
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.159
- It's like lickin' tile. - Oh!

490
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.400
I swear... it's time someone made an honest man out of me.

491
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.019
Whatever you need, the whole nine yards,

492
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.260
you got it.

493
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.580
The thing is, RÃ­cko... it's time.

494
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.586
Oh, [BLEEP], oh, [BLEEP]. It's time!

495
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.980
Oh, my God, it's wonderful.

496
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.200
Oh, wow. So we don't have to, you know, r-raise it?

497
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.200
Nah. They're ready to go right out of the box.

498
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.060
Cool, cool. So... bye?

499
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.540
Yep. Take care of yourself, Rick.

500
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.260
Yep. Same.

501
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.484
That was easy.

502
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.380
Houston, permission to open the starboard panel.

503
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.690
Permission granted.

504
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.130
Firing breach now.

505
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.480
Explorer, our readouts show a pressure spike.

506
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.520
Everything all right?

507
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.400
Honestly, sometimes staring back at Earth

508
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.130
makes me think about the people I left behind...

509
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.300
my wife, the son she had to anchor me there.

510
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.400
I tried to be a parent, I really did,

511
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.760
but I've come to find I'm only suited to be a spaceman.

512
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.240
The nicest part of being up here

513
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.160
is there are no reminders of the guilt

514
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.970
I sometimes feel about abandoning my family.

515
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.549
Sorry, Houston, I thought I heard something.

516
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.980
Negative on our end.

517
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.710
No, wait, there's something big

518
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.499
- and it's coming right at you! - Goo, goo, gah, gah.

519
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.540
Dear God. No! You can't be real!

520
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.170
Explorer, what is it? What the hell do you see?!

521
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.562
My conscience.

522
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.480
- Explorer! Explorer! - Aaah!

523
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.520
- Are you there? - Aaaaaah!

524
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.060
- Geez. Not gonna miss that guy. - Aaaaah!

525
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.770
Right? So dramatic.

526
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.940
Did you get any of that?
