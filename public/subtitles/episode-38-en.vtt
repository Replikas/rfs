00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.894
Aah, aah!

2
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.729
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.379
Holy [BLEEP].

4
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.939
- Oh. - What are... What are these things?!

5
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.010
Do I look like I know?

6
00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.099
Last thing I remember, I was, ugh, in a cave

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.419
looking at some wet egg and... Oh, that probably did it.

8
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.839
I told you not to look at that egg!

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.887
I-It was too wet.

10
00:00:35.888 --> 00:00:37.359
You don't get to tell me what to look at.

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.526
I've seen your Pornhub account.

12
00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.127
Also, who makes a Pornhub account?

13
00:00:40.128 --> 00:00:42.397
The algorithm learns your preferences better that way.

14
00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:44.419
Plus if you get in kind of a cool enough relationship,

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.989
you can sort of follow each other

16
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.539
and check out each other's kinks, you know?

17
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.079
All right, God damn, sold.

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.499
- How do we get out of here? - Morty, relax.

19
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.739
They're face-hugging parasites.

20
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.140
I don't think their society's gonna be that hard to navigate.

21
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.470
Okay, yeah, this might be a little harder than I thought.

22
00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:02.397
Holy [BLEEP] They've got an M&M's store.

23
00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:38.709
This is bad, Rick. Th-Th-Th-Th-This is really bad.

24
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.659
Just be cool, Morty. All we gotta do is blend in,

25
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.600
find our ship, and get the [BLEEP] outta here.

26
00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:45.386
All right, Morty, here's the plan, put this back on your face.

27
00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:46.889
I-I'm not putting that back on my face!

28
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.957
Relax. It's dead.

29
00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.479
Okay, now it's dead.

30
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.157
Come on, hurry up.

31
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.560
Rick, i-it's bleeding.

32
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.599
I-It's bleeding acid.

33
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.999
All right, well, that should be the last of it.

34
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.705
If not, then just gimme two tugs on the arm.

35
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.239
Seems like a self-destructive life cycle.

36
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.547
Is that gonna happen to us?

37
00:02:07.548 --> 00:02:08.977
You feel an egg in your stomach?

38
00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:11.919
- No. - Well, glass half full.

39
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.087
- How's it going? - 'Sup.

40
00:02:13.088 --> 00:02:14.499
- Glory to Glorzo. - Totally.

41
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.719
Love Glorzo.

42
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.309
Glorzo is peace.

43
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.019
Peace is Glorzo.

44
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.327
Wow, just cogs in the machine, y'know?

45
00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:23.127
- Ma-Makes you think... - Yeah, I'm sure you'll make this

46
00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:25.179
into a beautiful short film that your parents'll pay for,

47
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.299
Morty, but right now, we really just need to find my ship.

48
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.790
You sure you're not just jealous?

49
00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:31.109
Looks like I'm kind of a celebrity around here.

50
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.697
The future is Glorzo!

51
00:02:32.698 --> 00:02:35.189
Oh, my God. I was just reading you.

52
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.179
Congratulations on making it into print media.

53
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.260
Real bright future there.

54
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.677
Honestly, it's shocking to see the two of you together.

55
00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:43.677
Because we're both geniuses?

56
00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:45.447
No, because I've seen your videos,

57
00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:46.960
and you make me [BLEEP] sick.

58
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:48.820
Fix him.

59
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.199
Glory to Glorzo.

60
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.786
Sir, you shouldn't wander off like that.

61
00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:54.928
We've been looking all over for you.

62
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.757
The project is ready for your approval.

63
00:02:56.758 --> 00:02:58.457
Sir, is this man bothering you?

64
00:02:58.458 --> 00:02:59.949
Um, no, h-he's fine.

65
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.859
Uh, what... what project?

66
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.894
Jesus Christ, who the [BLEEP] was I?

67
00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:07.680
Here's a scientific fact I'm not allowed to say...

68
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.037
Our hosts are biologically designed to incubate our eggs.

69
00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:14.319
If that "triggers" you, [BLEEP] off.

70
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.879
If it doesn't, please like and subscribe.

71
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.650
New videos every Glorzday.

72
00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:19.377
God, was I at least rich?

73
00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:21.099
I mean, d-d-did I at least sell out

74
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.547
and sell vitamins or something?

75
00:03:22.548 --> 00:03:24.079
Rick, I've watched enough Pornhub to know

76
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.550
what a studio apartment looks like.

77
00:03:25.558 --> 00:03:26.949
God damn.

78
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.128
Jesus, your Glorzo got [BLEEP] done.

79
00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.199
My lord, we await your command.

80
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.966
Oh, to... shoot it? A-At people?

81
00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:36.567
Glorzo is peace.

82
00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:38.179
All shall be made Glorzo.

83
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.263
Glory to Glorzo.

84
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.570
I... did this?

85
00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:45.337
You and the amazing technology you both brought us.

86
00:03:45.338 --> 00:03:46.936
Yeah, makes sense.

87
00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:47.939
A-And where was this heading?

88
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.044
Earth? Probably Earth?

89
00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:50.659
The humans call it "Earth."

90
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.977
Yeah, well, okay, first of all, great work.

91
00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:54.848
You guys obviously put a lot of work into this.

92
00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.479
- Okay. - And y'know, it shows.

93
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.469
I-It really shows. But um...

94
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.929
I-I've been thinking, and, you know,

95
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.285
maybe we should just call this off.

96
00:04:01.286 --> 00:04:03.619
Sorry, is... is there more?

97
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.679
Nope, nope.

98
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.919
I-I guess, uh, that... that's it.

99
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.779
Just don't Glorzo Earth.

100
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.597
Just would've been nice to have heard this sooner

101
00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:14.506
before we spent all day on it.

102
00:04:14.507 --> 00:04:16.466
Yeah, well, I-I'm just hearing about it, too.

103
00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:17.867
- You ordered it. - Right.

104
00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:19.449
I-I did, and, um...

105
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.459
I'm just saying for next time,

106
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.306
maybe put more thought into it before a whole day of...

107
00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:25.059
Okay, well, I'm sorry I made you do your job for a [BLEEP] day!

108
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.579
You look like you were all really busy

109
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.079
- before I came and [BLEEP] it all up. - Boy, oh, boy, huh?

110
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.399
This guy's a genius, but at... but at what price, you know?

111
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.548
Y'know, [BLEEP] you, Rick!

112
00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:33.399
Who's... Rick?

113
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.527
Yeah, well, if we're free to ask questions,

114
00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:38.257
why haven't you blinked, uh, for 20 minutes,

115
00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:41.867
and why, uh, doesn't your mouth move when you talk?

116
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.799
Ah, geez, look at me.

117
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.767
I-I feel down on... on... on the floor.

118
00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:50.234
Oh, let... let me, uh, help... help you out here, buddy.

119
00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:52.640
Ah, thanks, man. Thanks, pal. That's right.

120
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.810
I'm right back where... where... right back in the saddle here.

121
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.770
All right, [BLEEP] it, run.

122
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.849
I-I hate this! I hate all of this!

123
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.308
Yeah, yeah, keep that feedback coming, Morty.

124
00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:27.779
It can only help.

125
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.669
- Oh, [BLEEP] - Aw, man!

126
00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.629
How big is this city?!

127
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.017
I know, it's like pick a lane.

128
00:05:38.018 --> 00:05:39.592
Are you face huggers or industrialists?

129
00:05:42.803 --> 00:05:45.127
Damn, feels kinda good when there's no guilt, huh?

130
00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:46.527
Yeah, it's... it's like in "Star Wars."

131
00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:48.640
Yeah, just like in "Star Wars." Go nuts!

132
00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:55.459
Nice, Morty! Give a little "yee-haw" if you want.

133
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.275
They... They always do a little "yee-haw" like a cowboy.

134
00:05:57.276 --> 00:05:58.699
Yee... Yee-ha... Yee-haw.

135
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.819
Good enough.

136
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.299
God, I needed this.

137
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.947
Honestly, it's been a while since I've been able

138
00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:14.184
to just let loose, you know?

139
00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:15.819
Just have fun. I'm... I'm...

140
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.378
I'm sorry if I've been taking it out on you.

141
00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.627
No, I get it. You got a lot on your plate, amigo.

142
00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:21.027
I-I just wish you'd open up

143
00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:22.358
to me more about it sometimes, you know?

144
00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:23.424
I-I-I'm your partner.

145
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.179
Thanks, Morty. I mean that. Thank you.

146
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.805
Sometimes, I get a little in my head, you know?

147
00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:28.579
Hey, man, that head's a good place to be.

148
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.555
Just remember to let me in sometimes, you know?

149
00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.101
Will do, buddy. Mother[BLEEP]

150
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.474
Oh, my God, this is so much fun!

151
00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:41.150
- I don't want to stop! - Yeah, it's like popping bubble wrap.

152
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.980
Honestly, I'm proud of us for not.

153
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.353
Totally. It would've been cheap.

154
00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:57.120
Yeah, real low-hanging fruit, and we're better than that.

155
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.089
Pearl Harbor, on the other hand...

156
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.716
Yeah, I think that's in-bounds.

157
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.899
I am the god of death!

158
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.641
Should've been a better species!

159
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.890
So, you did a 9/11?

160
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.279
Almost did a 9/11.

161
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.819
We... We went with a Pearl Harbor.

162
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.028
We're pretty classy.

163
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:26.239
Why were either of those an option?

164
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.319
Ask the Saudis.

165
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.620
Wow. Damn.

166
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.854
Yeah, getting political.

167
00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:31.769
I'm political now. How 'bout you, Jerry?

168
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.989
You got anything to add to the family dynamic?

169
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.542
I've been getting into beekeeping lately.

170
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.164
Is something wrong with that?

171
00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:42.400
What's wrong with that?

172
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.882
Don't I have the right to be happy? To exist?

173
00:07:44.883 --> 00:07:46.659
I'm sorry I didn't 9/11 Pearl Harbor

174
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.719
before breakfast, but I have a life, too!

175
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.419
- I have dreams! - And how's Summer?

176
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.550
Did she have fun, too?

177
00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:55.089
Oh. Uh-um.

178
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.879
Summer... was...

179
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.057
With us.

180
00:07:58.058 --> 00:07:59.487
There.

181
00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:02.049
You saw us take her in the car with us.

182
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.259
- Mm, yes. - Yes, yes, of course.

183
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.439
Th-That's what happened.

184
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.327
- And now she's... - Sleepy.

185
00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:09.459
Um, she's... she's sleepy.

186
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.540
Really sleepy.

187
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.118
- That's why she's not here. - So sleepy.

188
00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:13.529
She's sleepy?!

189
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.679
What the hell was that?!

190
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.919
- I didn't see you trying anything! - [BLEEP] the bed isn't better

191
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.037
than not [BLEEP] the bed!

192
00:08:18.038 --> 00:08:19.334
Where's Summer?!

193
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.709
Geez. Oh, man.

194
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.549
You know, maybe we went too hardcore on these guys.

195
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.719
Yeah, why do you think we never go back

196
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.779
to a place we've already been?

197
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.299
Do you know how many adventures we could get out

198
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.099
of Purge Planet, Morty? Gear World?

199
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.931
I don't sequel. It's called integrity.

200
00:08:33.932 --> 00:08:35.059
Here, put this back on your face.

201
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.269
- You kept it? - Oh, did you want a new one?

202
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.779
- 'Sup? - Yo.

203
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.567
Oh, [BLEEP] It's them!

204
00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:44.749
The worst thing to ever happen to us!

205
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.774
Yeah, that makes sense.

206
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.112
Sorry, Morty, we tried pussin' it. Time to go in hot.

207
00:08:48.113 --> 00:08:50.908
Rickputer, initiate unnecessarily badass suit-up.

208
00:09:02.448 --> 00:09:04.045
Let's lick [BLEEP]

209
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.719
Shouldn't we be finding Summer?

210
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.127
Oh, right, gee, sorry. I got caught up again.

211
00:09:15.128 --> 00:09:16.939
God, d-do I need to take more Adderall,

212
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.038
or am I taking too much Adderall?

213
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.879
Man, really shouldn't have gone with swords.

214
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.774
I know. My wrists are killing me.

215
00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:32.959
Flame-throwers next time, for sure.

216
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.379
Can I get a laser whip?

217
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.162
Okay, but there's no way you don't chop your dick off.

218
00:09:39.123 --> 00:09:41.457
Sum Sum, come with us if you want to live...

219
00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:44.793
at a lower standard than this, I guess. God damn.

220
00:09:44.794 --> 00:09:46.659
Empress, is everything all right?

221
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.881
Ummm... seize them!

222
00:09:48.882 --> 00:09:50.715
- Seize them?! - What?!

223
00:09:50.716 --> 00:09:52.556
- Summer, you bitch! - You gotta be kidding me!

224
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.819
âª Nobody knows the trouble I've seen âª

225
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.007
You know that song, Rick?

226
00:09:58.008 --> 00:09:59.399
From the... When the prisoners sing it?

227
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.810
Come on, Morty, for [BLEEP] sake.

228
00:10:00.818 --> 00:10:03.417
It's my jail time. I-I can spend it however I want.

229
00:10:05.488 --> 00:10:07.199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy! Hey, hey, hey!

230
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.319
Not in here! Not in here!

231
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.330
Aw... Gimme that.

232
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.497
Leave us.

233
00:10:14.498 --> 00:10:16.367
What the [BLEEP] took you so long?!

234
00:10:16.368 --> 00:10:18.327
- You left me here. - We didn't know you were with us!

235
00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:20.205
Do you know how much [BLEEP] I've had to deal with?

236
00:10:20.206 --> 00:10:21.579
You're in a cape, Summer.

237
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.680
How bad could it be?

238
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.699
No bad story ends with a cape.

239
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.020
You don't know anything about my story.

240
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.254
"I couldn't help but wonder,

241
00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:33.477
was Gharkhul really capable of consuming a living sun,

242
00:10:33.478 --> 00:10:36.314
or was I simply getting too close to Gharkhul?

243
00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:37.959
Was Gharkhul consuming me?"

244
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.478
Rick, can we listen to something else?

245
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.079
Quiet! She's just about to summon Gharkhul.

246
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.899
She's been talking about summoning Gharkhul

247
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.279
for three episodes, Summer.

248
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.019
Wait a minute, what's that in your mouth?

249
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.119
It's a toothpick.

250
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.259
I'm a toothpicker now. Get used to it.

251
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.109
God, are you that desperate for a thing?

252
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.059
It is my thing.

253
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.170
Just like yours is dying alone and yours is jerking off.

254
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.099
At least jerking off tracks for my character, you know?

255
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.219
I like to jerk off.

256
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.419
- I'm 14. I own it. - Well, I jerk off, too!

257
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.719
- All right, stop. - Jesus Chris, I don't wanna think

258
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.799
- about that [BLEEP] - Summer, keep your toothpick.

259
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.268
- Gross! - Morty, stop talking to your sister

260
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.212
about jerking off. Everyone pretend podcasting isn't boring.

261
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.479
Whoa, Morty, look how wet this egg is.

262
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.540
I dunno, Rick. That looks a little too wet.

263
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.999
- D-Don't touch it. - Oh, I'm gonna touch it.

264
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.097
Why are you guys screaming at an egg?

265
00:11:19.098 --> 00:11:20.239
Shut up, Summer!

266
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.856
- Just let us look at an egg! - Yeah, Summer, shut the [BLEEP] up.

267
00:11:21.857 --> 00:11:23.059
- [BLEEP] [BLEEP] - Nobody wants you here.

268
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.488
You know, sometimes we like to go on adventures

269
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.920
and look at wet eggs, you know?

270
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.438
Can we just go? This place is giving me the creeps.

271
00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:30.232
- Holy [BLEEP] I love this egg. - Hey, look, mine's doing it, too.

272
00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:31.840
Are you guys sure that's safe?

273
00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:34.729
Oh, my God!

274
00:11:38.408 --> 00:11:39.952
All is Glorzo.

275
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.457
All is Glorzo.

276
00:11:47.918 --> 00:11:49.249
- God. - God.

277
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.579
God? She has a toothpick.

278
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.939
Take it out and put her face in an egg.

279
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.949
- God. - God.

280
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.059
For [BLEEP] sake, how long have you been hatched?

281
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.094
30 seconds?

282
00:11:58.095 --> 00:12:00.367
I've been alive seven minutes.

283
00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:02.879
- Think before you... - Excuse me, seven minutes?

284
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.279
Uh, I've been here for 29 minutes.

285
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.311
But yes, take the toothpick out of her mouth.

286
00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:10.699
Suck on her face this instant and use her body to...

287
00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.028
What was that?

288
00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:18.109
That is called responsibility.

289
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.239
He was part of our greatest generation.

290
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.450
He understood that what you need to do is suck on a face,

291
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.870
shit an egg, and die.

292
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:26.939
Wait, so, all you do is live half an hour,

293
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.208
[BLEEP] eggs, and die?

294
00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:29.799
Yes. We love it.

295
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.097
I'll do it right now.

296
00:12:35.048 --> 00:12:37.439
Okay, you guys don't have to listen to me,

297
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.430
but I vote you don't do that?

298
00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:41.840
And who's up for changing things around here?

299
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.979
âª Well, I was hatched from an egg laid by some guy âª

300
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.779
âª 'Cause that is Glorzo's way âª

301
00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.919
âª And then it came time to lay my own egg and die âª

302
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.459
âª But Summer, she said âª

303
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.930
âª "Hey, Glorzo wants you to stay" âª

304
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.019
âª Glory to Glorzo âª

305
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.330
âª Means glory to me âª

306
00:13:14.338 --> 00:13:16.179
âª If we're only making eggs âª

307
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.199
âª Are we ever making Glorzo free? âª

308
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.019
All right, look, uh, this [BLEEP] been brewing for a while.

309
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.930
I'm not gonna win any popularity contests by saying it,

310
00:13:25.932 --> 00:13:28.147
but here's... here's the world as I see it.

311
00:13:28.148 --> 00:13:31.687
âª And for all we know âª âª Everything we've known âª

312
00:13:31.688 --> 00:13:35.387
âª Is just some shit we made up âª

313
00:13:35.388 --> 00:13:38.444
âª Glory to Glorzo âª

314
00:13:38.445 --> 00:13:42.031
âª Means glory to me âª

315
00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:43.449
âª We got too many eggs and not enough society âª

316
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.576
I mean, look, we are designed to suck on faces and lay eggs.

317
00:13:45.577 --> 00:13:48.637
Life is life, and that's the way it goes.

318
00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:56.517
Hello, Troy. Hello, Jez.

319
00:13:56.518 --> 00:13:58.719
- How is it going? - Really good, commander.

320
00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.919
Should be ready by tomorrow.

321
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.579
That is what I like to hear.

322
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.487
Great work, Glory to Glorzo.

323
00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:06.687
Honestly, Summer, I can't thank you enough.

324
00:14:06.688 --> 00:14:09.327
When we met, we were just shitting eggs in a cave,

325
00:14:09.328 --> 00:14:12.327
but you showed us life is about more than that.

326
00:14:12.328 --> 00:14:13.719
It is about living.

327
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.827
And now, with these missiles,

328
00:14:15.828 --> 00:14:18.597
we will be able to reach the entire universe.

329
00:14:18.598 --> 00:14:22.599
We say it all the time, but I guess all is Glorzo.

330
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.879
Yeah, that sounds great.

331
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.630
- And you've been great. - Yeah.

332
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.599
You've been so great that I've been thinking

333
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.621
maybe it's time for you to get off my brother.

334
00:14:29.622 --> 00:14:31.520
Who's your brother?

335
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.609
Oh, this?

336
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.179
Forgot he was there, haha.

337
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.793
Wait. What are you saying?

338
00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:37.587
I'm saying that you've been great, Steve,

339
00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:39.922
but we've been thinking it's time for a new chapter.

340
00:14:39.923 --> 00:14:42.159
- We? - Uh, this is Shane.

341
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.580
He'll be handling the day-to-day.

342
00:14:43.588 --> 00:14:45.093
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

343
00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:46.919
I might only be two minutes old,

344
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.931
but I know you're a legend.

345
00:14:48.932 --> 00:14:50.567
She doesn't care about us.

346
00:14:50.568 --> 00:14:52.634
She just wants her [BLEEP] host back.

347
00:14:52.635 --> 00:14:55.179
- I don't know what to do. - Oh, now you want my help.

348
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.272
Too late for that.

349
00:14:56.273 --> 00:14:57.637
Come on, man. What is this [BLEEP]

350
00:14:57.638 --> 00:14:59.019
You don't get to do this to me.

351
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.274
We were in eggs together.

352
00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.679
Oh, [BLEEP] since we were in eggs.

353
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.189
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, now you respect, like,

354
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.160
the biological institutions now?

355
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.499
[BLEEP] you. All you care about

356
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.919
is "progress" and society and skyscrapers.

357
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.630
You don't care about [BLEEP] biology.

358
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.920
Oh, yeah, well, what the [BLEEP]

359
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.679
You... How you you haven't laid and egg inside this old man yet?

360
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.899
Because I do what I want.

361
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.468
Because someone's gotta stand up for what's right.

362
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.669
Why do you hate her so much?

363
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.338
Because she took you away from me!

364
00:15:22.328 --> 00:15:24.167
Whoa, man. Jesus Christ.

365
00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:26.737
- No, I-I didn't, I... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

366
00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:28.888
It's cool.

367
00:15:28.889 --> 00:15:30.910
I feel the same way.

368
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.400
Oh, my God, I...

369
00:15:37.408 --> 00:15:39.159
I wish we could suck on each other.

370
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.640
- I wanna suck on you, too. - I'm gonna suck you so hard.

371
00:15:41.648 --> 00:15:43.389
- Suck me. - C-C-Can we do this?

372
00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.839
A-A-Are we allowed to do this?

373
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.579
I don't care. I just want you.

374
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.959
[BLEEP] all of this.

375
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.219
Let's just get the hell outta here

376
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.197
and be whatever the [BLEEP] we want.

377
00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:53.829
That's evolution. That's progress.

378
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.079
I want a family.

379
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.327
Can we have a family.

380
00:15:56.328 --> 00:15:58.418
Yeah.

381
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.380
Aah, aah!

382
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.219
Oh, my God.

383
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.879
Holy [BLEEP]

384
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.379
- Oh. - What are... What are these things?!

385
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.430
Do I look like I know?

386
00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:21.719
Hey, wait a second. How'd you know that last part?

387
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.479
- You weren't there for that. - I had to fill in some gaps.

388
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.799
Everyone around the office knew about Steve and Bruce.

389
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.740
I've got a plan, okay. You just have to follow my lead.

390
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.360
The punishment is... death.

391
00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:34.454
- Mother[BLEEP] Summer! - You said you had a plan!

392
00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:35.469
Silence.

393
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.706
The council of Glorzos has spoken.

394
00:16:37.707 --> 00:16:39.124
More like council of [BLEEP]

395
00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:41.137
- Glorzo is law. - Silence.

396
00:16:41.138 --> 00:16:43.977
The punishment is death.

397
00:16:43.978 --> 00:16:46.599
By... getting their car.

398
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.069
- Summer? - Shut up.

399
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.999
Yes, place them in the car.

400
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.388
Those pieces of [BLEEP]

401
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:54.159
No, no, no! This is like torture.

402
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.159
No, I-I-I-I hate being in my car.

403
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.390
You deserve it, you pieces of [BLEEP]

404
00:16:58.395 --> 00:17:00.697
And to make sure the sentence is passed,

405
00:17:00.698 --> 00:17:02.557
I shall be joining them.

406
00:17:02.558 --> 00:17:03.649
In the car.

407
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.079
And we shall drive away from here and die.

408
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.879
Oooookay.

409
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.240
Guess what, everybody.

410
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.999
It's me, the whiny guy you never want to hear from.

411
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.907
She's trying to escape with her family.

412
00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:17.119
My time to shine. Execute her.

413
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.416
Okay, plan B. Morty, now.

414
00:17:21.876 --> 00:17:24.003
Aah!

415
00:17:24.004 --> 00:17:25.671
Jesus, Morty, that sucks.

416
00:17:25.672 --> 00:17:27.923
All right, stop playing, Morty. I-I got this.

417
00:17:29.718 --> 00:17:30.839
Aah!

418
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.449
This is what we get for evolving?

419
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.527
Sorry! Sorry.

420
00:17:40.528 --> 00:17:42.731
I-I'm sorry. We... We... We thought you were evil.

421
00:17:42.732 --> 00:17:44.099
Why would you think that?

422
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.429
We had a giant tower that blared "Glorzo is peace."

423
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.760
I know. I... Should... Should we help?

424
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.234
- Boo! - Oh, like that's helping.

425
00:17:51.235 --> 00:17:53.617
Got it. Going. Okay, we're gonna hit the road.

426
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.283
You're... You're just going?

427
00:17:55.284 --> 00:17:56.409
You told us to go!

428
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.447
Once again, I'm so sorry for what they...

429
00:17:58.448 --> 00:17:59.947
You're part of this, too. Boo!

430
00:17:59.948 --> 00:18:01.124
We hate you the most.

431
00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:02.167
Get out.

432
00:18:03.488 --> 00:18:05.319
Jesus, Summer, why'd you let these things

433
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.380
stay on us for so long?

434
00:18:06.388 --> 00:18:07.954
I was working with a lot.

435
00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:10.008
Just let me listen to the podcast next time.

436
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.597
Nailed that landing.

437
00:18:18.438 --> 00:18:20.837
Huh. Neat-looking egg.

438
00:18:26.232 --> 00:18:28.579
Okay, well, I'm not cleaning up this [BLEEP]

439
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.190
Aah!

440
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.239
Maybe we, uh... Maybe we don't tell people about this one.

441
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.657
Did we at least learn something?

442
00:18:39.658 --> 00:18:41.927
That we suck and everyone sucks?

443
00:18:41.928 --> 00:18:44.084
I guess that counts.

444
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.059
Later, chodes.

445
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.630
Hit me on the next one.

446
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.959
You know, Rick, I'm sure you wanna jump

447
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.719
into another crazy adventure, but can we just relax

448
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.539
and maybe watch some interdimensional cable?

449
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.429
- I'm cool if you are. - Honestly, that sounds great.

450
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.340
W-We don't need to try so hard, you know.

451
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.107
Let's just take it easy and riff, you know.

452
00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:04.277
- That's what I love about us. - Me, too, buddy.

453
00:19:04.278 --> 00:19:06.188
Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

454
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.948
Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

455
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.818
Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

456
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.439
Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

457
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.628
- Reggie? - Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

458
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.188
Reggie, you all right in there?

459
00:19:14.189 --> 00:19:16.980
Mm, Rick, do you feel...

460
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.127
Oh, God, I have to shit an egg.

461
00:19:19.128 --> 00:19:20.367
Oh, my God, oh, [BLEEP]

462
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:21.930
Oh, it hurts. Oh, God,

463
00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.119
- is this how we die, Rick? - I don't know, Morty.

464
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.550
- Is this how we die?! - I don't know! Aah!

465
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.679
I don't want to [BLEEP] an egg, Rick!

466
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.719
I'm sorry, Morty. I'm sorry!

467
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.087
- It's my fault. It's all my fault! - Hey, you two. Did you...

468
00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:32.549
Beth, your son is dying! Say goodbye!

469
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.709
What are you...

470
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.039
Say goodbye to your little boy!

471
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.099
No, look away!

472
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.810
I'm making an egg, Mom. I'm making an egg!

473
00:19:38.816 --> 00:19:40.889
You said you'd keep me more in the loop this year.

474
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.139
Look away, Beth! Daddy loves you!

475
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.679
My ass! My ass!

476
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.879
This is it, Morty!

477
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.564
It's full circle from the pilot. Full circle!

478
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.827
Oh, I guess we, uh...

479
00:19:55.828 --> 00:19:57.219
I guess we both just had to take a [BLEEP]

480
00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.989
Yeah, I-I-I guess we, uh...

481
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.199
[BLEEP] gross.

482
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.279
Guys, clean it up.

483
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.599
Look at your dad.

484
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.799
Such a dork, keeping bees.

485
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.340
I mean, it's... at least it's interesting, though.

486
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.704
At least, like... I wish my dad kept bees.

487
00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.599
I mean, it's kind of cute.

488
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.109
Like... your dad keeps bees.

489
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.499
How old is your dad?

490
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.827
He's obviously beekeeping age.

491
00:20:58.828 --> 00:21:01.888
I don't know, I think it's kind of sweet.

492
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.169
Summer, I want to [BLEEP] your dad.

493
00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.185
Oh, really?
