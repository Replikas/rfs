00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:46.638
âª Don't look back âª

548
00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:49.308
âª Nothin' left to see âª

549
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:53.270
âª Just leave the shadows in the past âª

550
00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:56.398
âª If I let it go âª

551
00:21:56.481 --> 00:22:01.987
âª Can I shake this feeling? âª

552
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.490
âª Oh-oh-oh âª

553
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:08.618
âª Just like that âª

554
00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:14.499
âª Tomorrow's one day that I'm never getting back âª

555
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:17.669
âª I can feel you, though âª

556
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:22.841
âª Wake me from this dreamin' âª

557
00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:26.136
Ooooo-weeee! Season eight. Huh?

558
00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:29.515
I liked when Jerry was the Easter Bunny.

559
00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.225
That was fun. Oh, and that...

560
00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:34.061
Who is he... Who's he talking to?

561
00:22:34.144 --> 00:22:35.437
I could never tell.

562
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.647
But that data is irrefutable.

563
00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:39.691
His atoms vibrate on a frequency

564
00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:42.110
unlike any found in our whole reality.

565
00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:44.363
And you believe this traveler came here

566
00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:46.156
to replace your husband?

567
00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:49.702
I know I sound insane and self-centered for thinking that.

568
00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:51.704
The facts reveal you to be the opposite.

569
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.747
You've been very brave, Amy.

570
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.416
What would you have us do with him?

571
00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:01.671
Man: Did you get any of that?
