1
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.879
Oh, shit, I almost parked.

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.920
- Hey, Morty, hold on, Wat-watch this. - _

3
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.799
- Uh-huh. - Well, I thought it was cool.

4
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.379
So. We should be in and out.

5
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.499
Simple exchange, not even really an adventure.

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.439
And if anything goes wrong... which it won't...

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.339
jump into the same vat of acid I jump into.

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.644
Okay. Wait... Wait, what?

9
00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:33.399
- Wha-What vat of acid? - What, Morty!

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.659
Close the door.

11
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.879
I pre-scouted this location

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.999
and placed a vat of fake acid amongst the real ones.

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.487
It's got air hoses and a compartment of bones at the bottom.

14
00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:42.419
If things go wrong, which they won't,

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.739
we jump into the vat of acid,

16
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.379
and I'll release the bones, they'll float up...

17
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.979
- What is this face you're making? - Aren't you an inventor?

18
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.599
Yeah, what part of a fake acid vat with built-in air supply

19
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.844
and quick-release bones isn't inventive enough for you,

20
00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:55.159
and when did my job become pitching you ideas?

21
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.219
All right! Let's just do this.

22
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.399
- I have English homework. - You're still learning English?

23
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.089
That's the language you speak.

24
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.189
How dumb are you?

25
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.560
Interesting choice of meeting place, Rick.

26
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.119
You like it? My grandson had notes.

27
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.325
- Come on. - Show him the crystals, Morty.

28
00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:19.449
I'll make lots of money with these.

29
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.833
I'll make lots of those with these.

30
00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.459
Well. Those are fake.

31
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.336
- Oh, Jesus [BLEEP] Christ. Come on. - You gotta be kidding me. Seriously?

32
00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:26.379
You brought fake crystals and a gun?

33
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.214
Beats real crystals and no gun.

34
00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:30.800
Okay, but does anything beat fake crystals and a fake arm?

35
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.107
Whoa, do you know who I am?!

36
00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:35.347
Even if you kill me, you're a dead man.

37
00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:36.477
Are you serious?

38
00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:37.917
Morty, he's right. We're screwed.

39
00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:39.578
Let's just end it. Quick death, come on.

40
00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.188
Aw, man. Oh!

41
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.064
Eh!

42
00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.859
Holy [BLEEP]. What the [BLEEP]?

43
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.420
_

44
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.390
- Holy [BLEEP]. - What kind of psycho...?

45
00:01:57.398 --> 00:01:59.080
His own grandson?

46
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.499
Guess he took your threat pretty serious.

47
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.833
Yeah, but it just...

48
00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:05.329
doesn't make any sense.

49
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.207
Well, he was a scientist.

50
00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:08.899
Maybe he knew more about acid,

51
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.539
maybe it's like the most painless way to go.

52
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.679
How could that have been painless?

53
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.379
You saw that pause before the bones floated up,

54
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.340
that had to be five seconds of unparalleled torture.

55
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.557
I... I can't get my head around it.

56
00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:25.057
I-I thought I'd seen this galaxy at its darkest.

57
00:02:25.058 --> 00:02:28.329
This is... This is gonna take a while to feel normal.

58
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.979
We're pretty good listeners, boss.

59
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.899
Drinks are on us if you want to talk it out.

60
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.629
Thanks, but... what happened, it happened here.

61
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.979
I don't want to lose the moment.

62
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.079
Take your time, boss.

63
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.779
We'll stay here as long as you want.

64
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.239
Absolutely. I got nowhere to be.

65
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.899
_

66
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.099
And then little Tommy FlimFlam's

67
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.909
running down the Hyperloop.

68
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.739
His ass is on fire from Xenon fluid,

69
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.839
but his AI hologram is [BLEEP] his own pee [BLEEP].

70
00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:31.719
- Great story, boss. - Really detailed.

71
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.750
Yeah, well, I got a million of 'em.

72
00:03:33.758 --> 00:03:36.844
All right. I think I'm ready to deal with the world now.

73
00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:37.979
Let's get out of here.

74
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.667
Should we drop our buddy in here before we go?

75
00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:41.969
Yeah, probably a good idea.

76
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.309
- _ - Should we use a different vat?

77
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.260
Does acid lose its acid power the more it dissolves?

78
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.819
What am I, an acidologist?

79
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.339
Here, grab that ratlike creature,

80
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.483
we'll do a little test.

81
00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:55.487
Look, if you're going to test the damn acid, don't use a rat,

82
00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:58.820
take that ladle, grab a spoonful, and put it in the analyzer.

83
00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:02.499
- Oh! - Hey!

84
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.509
Oh!

85
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.623
Okay, I'd say that's pretty acidy.

86
00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:06.820
Drop him in.

87
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.079
What are you doing?

88
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.727
- You said... - Not the rat! The guy!

89
00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:14.737
Ooh! Marone!

90
00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:16.899
Look at the size of the bones on that rat!

91
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.969
Oh! How many sets of bones this rat got?

92
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.707
And look how the smaller ones are shaped!

93
00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:23.339
They're like little cartoon bones,

94
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.475
like if you drew a bone in art class!

95
00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:26.847
All right, that tears it.

96
00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:28.439
I'm canceling the rest of my night

97
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.039
and calling a bone scientist.

98
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.217
We're getting to the bottom of this...

99
00:04:31.218 --> 00:04:33.339
Jesus [BLEEP] Christ, enough already!

100
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.719
- Oh! - Hey!

101
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.487
Whoa!

102
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.920
Can we go?

103
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.404
The [BLEEP] is wrong with you?

104
00:04:58.405 --> 00:05:00.119
Just admit it was a shitty idea!

105
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.200
Having a grandson?

106
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:02.847
A vat of fake acid!

107
00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:04.249
Are you dying of dementia?

108
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.659
How are you talking to me like this?

109
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.939
Wh-When did you get so cocky?

110
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.619
Tonight! Tonight, Rick!

111
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.799
The night I saw you fail!

112
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.099
- Because you ruined it! - It was pre-ruined!

113
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.427
Oh, was it worse than when I was a pickle?

114
00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:15.227
Oh-oh-oh that's right, you weren't there for that.

115
00:05:15.228 --> 00:05:16.739
Turned out kind of cool.

116
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.539
- Maybe there's a connection there. - Excuse me?

117
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.819
What's that cool thing you did without me again?

118
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.499
The awesome thing? I-I-I guess you wanted a dragon?

119
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.059
Mwah. Unforgettable.

120
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.429
- God, [BLEEP] you. - Timely, too,

121
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.377
you really got in on that "Game of Thrones" fever right at the peak.

122
00:05:29.378 --> 00:05:31.939
You trying as hard as you can to hurt me right now

123
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.278
- proves my point. - I'll let you know when you have a point

124
00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.699
and the world will know when I try to hurt you.

125
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.219
Big man, big genius. Big lonely drunk.

126
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.247
Hey, save some of these atomic-age beatnik zingers

127
00:05:41.248 --> 00:05:43.137
for your English homework, Bukowski.

128
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.098
There's no such thing as a bad idea, Morty.

129
00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.930
It's about execution.

130
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.529
No such thing as a bad idea?

131
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.299
Except all of mine, right?

132
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.267
Morty, wanting a dragon isn't an idea.

133
00:05:56.268 --> 00:05:57.525
I'm not talking about that!

134
00:05:57.526 --> 00:05:59.667
I'm constantly pitching you ideas, Rick,

135
00:05:59.668 --> 00:06:01.419
and you act like they're not even worth thinking about!

136
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.959
What, the helicopter lawn chair?

137
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.407
That's just something you saw on TV.

138
00:06:04.408 --> 00:06:06.993
What about my video-game-style place-saving device?

139
00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:10.219
Oh, my God, here we go.

140
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.599
It's a good idea, Rick! A device that lets you...

141
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.159
Save your place like in a video game,

142
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.699
but in real life so that you can try stuff

143
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.019
and then go back to your save point,

144
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.919
yes, Morty, I saw it on "Futurama."

145
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.839
Oh, so you don't do anything unless it's original?

146
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.599
- I don't do time travel. - It's not time travel,

147
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.674
- it's saving a place in time... - Oh, my God,

148
00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:26.127
is this what you think I do?

149
00:06:26.128 --> 00:06:28.181
This is where the heavy lifting happens in your mind?

150
00:06:28.182 --> 00:06:30.119
Do you have any idea how much [BLEEP] work

151
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.339
- would have to go into a machine that... - Ah-ha!

152
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.979
- You can't do it! - I can do anything, Morty.

153
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.523
- Your idea is not worth doing. - You can't do it.

154
00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:41.219
Before what you're trying to do was called "negging,"

155
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.947
it was called "reverse psychology,"

156
00:06:42.948 --> 00:06:45.406
and incels didn't invent it, Bugs Bunny did.

157
00:06:45.407 --> 00:06:47.947
- You can't do it. - There is nothing I cannot do.

158
00:06:47.948 --> 00:06:50.217
- A place-saving video-game thing! - You're a piece of [BLEEP].

159
00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:51.859
- Just say you can't do it! - I won't!

160
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.879
You won't say you can't?

161
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.239
- [BLEEP] you, Morty! - [BLEEP] you!

162
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.727
[BLEEP] you!

163
00:06:56.728 --> 00:06:57.753
Son of a bitch.

164
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.790
- So are you gonna... - Yes, I'm gonna [BLEEP] do it!

165
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.639
Rick, it's 3:00 a.m.

166
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.559
Wh-Wh-What's going on? W-Why'd you call me?

167
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.100
You were right, Morty.

168
00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:13.764
I failed. I can't make it.

169
00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:15.499
And honestly, I'm pretty ashamed.

170
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.479
That might be why I've been so aggressive and unfair

171
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.309
- about rejecting your ideas. - Rick...

172
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.757
A fake acid vat, Morty?

173
00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:22.749
Maybe I've lost it. Maybe I never had it.

174
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.459
Hey. C'mon. Y-You know I didn't mean it that way.

175
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.489
I just think we need to find better ways to communicate.

176
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.467
I'm sorry. I just... I lash out sometimes.

177
00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:30.999
I-I-I don't know why I do that! I'm so ashamed of myself.

178
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.239
Hearing you talk about the vat...

179
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.369
it really opened my eyes.

180
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.959
- Like what the [BLEEP] am I even doing? - Hey. Hey.

181
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.207
I don't like hearing this talk. You're a great inventor.

182
00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:38.977
We just got a couple things to work on.

183
00:07:38.978 --> 00:07:40.777
Let's start with inventing a little honesty.

184
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:42.919
- Sound good? - Thank you, Morty. Sounds good.

185
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.299
- Or maybe I'll just kill you. - What?

186
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Rick...

187
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.059
- Because I [BLEEP] did it! - Oh-ho-ho!

188
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.699
- Booya! - Holy [BLEEP].

189
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.479
- You did it! You did it! - I did it, you little son of a bitch!

190
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.219
- How did you... - Morty, do you want me to explain,

191
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.409
or you wanna go have some fun?

192
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.481
I wanna have some fun!

193
00:07:59.482 --> 00:08:00.760
Oh, my God.

194
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.483
Rick, this is... this is... thank you!

195
00:08:02.484 --> 00:08:03.927
You can thank me later. Go nuts.

196
00:08:03.928 --> 00:08:05.167
Best grandpa ever!

197
00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:06.738
That's all I ever wanted to hear.

198
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.859
All right, class,

199
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.119
I know I've been absent for most of this school year.

200
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.134
I'll be honest with you... during spring break,

201
00:08:14.135 --> 00:08:15.579
I attended a renaissance faire

202
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.164
and fell in love with a buxom hand-axe juggler half my age.

203
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.099
I overplayed my interest in her lifestyle

204
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.344
just to get closer to her,

205
00:08:22.345 --> 00:08:23.919
traveling the country with her troupe,

206
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.887
and I am embarrassed to say I am now an expert blacksmith

207
00:08:26.888 --> 00:08:29.157
with several STDs and a broken heart.

208
00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:30.754
I beseech your nasty little asses

209
00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:32.419
to speak on the matter no further.

210
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.157
Now that that's out of the way, who wants to do some math?

211
00:08:35.158 --> 00:08:37.324
- I'll do it. - A bold move, Morty Smith.

212
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:38.349
But can you deliver?

213
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.198
Oh, I've got something to deliver.

214
00:08:40.199 --> 00:08:41.809
Ahh!

215
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.667
Oh, God. What the hell!

216
00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:45.359
Aw, goddamnit, this is traumatizing.

217
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.537
Oh, my God, what's wrong with your dick?

218
00:08:47.538 --> 00:08:49.572
- Not cool. - I'm allergic to sheepskin!

219
00:08:49.573 --> 00:08:51.999
Bold move, Morty Smith. But can you deliver?

220
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.799
Holy [BLEEP]. I can do anything.

221
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.699
Yes, with math, anything is possible.

222
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.389
Except a long-term relationship with a woman

223
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.875
that calls you a warlock for using a phone.

224
00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.849
Hi, uh, hey, Jessica.

225
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.340
Oh. Hey, Morty.

226
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.159
Hey... Jessica, right?

227
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.221
Um. Yeah. Hi. Sorry.

228
00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:14.567
I thought you knew my name

229
00:09:14.568 --> 00:09:16.079
because we've interacted so many times,

230
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.060
but maybe I was just being stupid.

231
00:09:18.068 --> 00:09:20.407
Sorry. Hi. I-I'm Jessica. That's me.

232
00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:21.521
- Cool. See you around. - Jessica.

233
00:09:21.522 --> 00:09:23.199
Yeah. I hope I see you.

234
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.919
- Around. - Guess we'll see.

235
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.819
I think I'm gonna like this thing.

236
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.300
_

237
00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.184
_

238
00:10:00.185 --> 00:10:03.009
_

239
00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:11.257
Oh shit, suicide by cop!

240
00:10:11.258 --> 00:10:12.827
I love these!

241
00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:19.099
You're living too fast, Morty.

242
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.109
I don't pay for your friendship, Heroin Keith.

243
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.119
Damn.

244
00:10:30.978 --> 00:10:35.317
_

245
00:10:52.487 --> 00:10:54.399
_

246
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.330
_

247
00:14:11.353 --> 00:14:13.980
_

248
00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.979
Oh, hi, Jessica.

249
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.699
Hey, I'm sorry I brushed you off the other day.

250
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.879
I was just trying to be cool...

251
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.819
Oh, I don't even know what you're talking about.

252
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.649
But... you seem different.

253
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.219
Like you finally found yourself.

254
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.702
Yeah. I... I guess I have.

255
00:15:09.703 --> 00:15:12.204
That's good to hear. I like who you found.

256
00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:13.917
Yeah. Yeah, I do, too.

257
00:15:13.918 --> 00:15:16.249
Looking forward to seeing more.

258
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.419
I'll see you tomorrow, Morty.

259
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.588
Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

260
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.419
How's it going?

261
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.343
Y'know, it was fun, Rick. Real fun.

262
00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.179
Y'know I-I-I definitely sowed those oats.

263
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.459
But I think you invented

264
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.359
a little lesson for me along the way.

265
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.999
Living without consequences is great,

266
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.359
but then I started wondering...

267
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.772
what am I living for? What am I building?

268
00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:41.019
If I'm always looking back, I'm never looking ahead.

269
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.029
And then it hit me.

270
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.549
We are who we are because of consequences.

271
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.740
You can't live without consequences, y'know? You feel me?

272
00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:50.637
Wow.

273
00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:53.124
That's a beautiful thought, Morty, but, uh, no.

274
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.739
There were definitely consequences.

275
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.208
What're-What-What are you talking about?

276
00:15:56.209 --> 00:15:58.399
I mean. You did everything you did.

277
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.919
- It all happened. - No. But the... the respawn button.

278
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.019
- The... The do-over. - It's not a do-over.

279
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.924
You just did it. Over and over.

280
00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:06.550
What are you saying? W-What did you do?

281
00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:08.802
I think it's more appropriate to ask what did you do?

282
00:16:08.803 --> 00:16:11.199
You see, Morty, you weren't saving your place

283
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.337
and going back. I don't respect time travel.

284
00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:16.007
If "Ant Man and the Wasp" can do it, I'm not interested.

285
00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.374
It wasn't so much a do-over

286
00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:19.229
as it was isolating a moment in time,

287
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.359
splitting your probable selves,

288
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.199
and shunting you into to into a near-duplicate,

289
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.779
equally probable reality, transporting you into it

290
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.610
at the moment of parallel determination.

291
00:16:26.613 --> 00:16:28.877
Pretty nifty. Time crystals are a bitch and a half,

292
00:16:28.878 --> 00:16:31.799
but the only real hitch is that there was already a you

293
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.047
in each probable dimension.

294
00:16:33.048 --> 00:16:34.496
So we had to solve for that.

295
00:16:40.252 --> 00:16:41.509
That's right, you little bitch!

296
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.279
It's "The Prestige"! You "Prestige'd" yourself!

297
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.504
- Rick, how many did I kill? - You tell me, Morty.

298
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.757
Every time you reset to smell Jessica's hair,

299
00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:50.094
every time you relived a satisfying fart,

300
00:16:50.095 --> 00:16:51.897
that's how many Mortys you've incinerated,

301
00:16:51.898 --> 00:16:53.297
you greedy little junkie.

302
00:16:53.298 --> 00:16:55.349
Oh, God... even those times when I...

303
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.009
Especially those times.

304
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.999
It's over, Morty. Feel this.

305
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.435
- Take this in. This is God. - Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...

306
00:17:01.436 --> 00:17:02.707
Why would you do this?

307
00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:05.104
My hands are clean, Morty. I gave you a choice.

308
00:17:05.105 --> 00:17:06.439
You could listen to me explain,

309
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.077
in great scientific detail, how it all works...

310
00:17:09.078 --> 00:17:10.249
or you could have fun.

311
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.139
- Did you have fun, Morty? - Is this because of the vat?

312
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.869
- No. - I'm sorry.

313
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.339
I'm afraid it's too late for that, Morty.

314
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.622
What's done is done, but it can end.

315
00:17:18.623 --> 00:17:20.727
The original split is still timestamped.

316
00:17:20.728 --> 00:17:22.994
I can make it so those Mortys never existed at all,

317
00:17:22.995 --> 00:17:24.539
make them purely theoretical.

318
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.549
Oh, God. What do I do?

319
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.047
I think it's clear you've done enough.

320
00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:29.466
Tell me how, Rick! Tell me how I save those Mortys!

321
00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:30.837
You live with the consequences.

322
00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:32.167
Those things happened somewhere,

323
00:17:32.168 --> 00:17:34.107
but you can merge the probable realities

324
00:17:34.108 --> 00:17:35.807
so that only one Morty did them.

325
00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:37.349
Just do it.

326
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.729
and get you back to your dimension.

327
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.760
Wait, so... so you're not even my Rick?

328
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.299
Then... Then why do you know about the vat?

329
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.639
Every Rick has a vat!

330
00:17:55.088 --> 00:17:56.349
Well, Morty,

331
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.579
I'd say we've invented a little honesty today.

332
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.340
- How about you? - I don't deserve this.

333
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.413
I was just having fun.

334
00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:02.439
So was Jeffrey Dahmer.

335
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.767
Speaking of, time to pay the piper.

336
00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:09.337
Morty Smith.

337
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:12.089
Come out with your hands up, you sick [BLEEP].

338
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.539
We're also fine with just shooting you

339
00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.179
if you wanna suicide by cop.

340
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.379
What? What is this?

341
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.014
Wow. Looks like a SWAT Team,

342
00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:19.179
some drug dealers,

343
00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.259
some grassroots MeToo activists, the ACLU...

344
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.940
Jesus, Morty, the AARP?

345
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.787
- I don't wanna talk about it! - The NAACP, GamerGate...

346
00:18:26.788 --> 00:18:29.859
Morty, is that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor?

347
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.479
I'm sorry! I... I'm sorry!

348
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.796
I-Is that what you want me to say?

349
00:18:32.798 --> 00:18:35.167
- What... What do I do? - Oof, well, I'm stumped.

350
00:18:35.168 --> 00:18:37.139
Seems like there's no way out of this one.

351
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.279
Unless...

352
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.919
God damn it.

353
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.239
Yeah, I guess it is, uh... what did you call it?

354
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.439
Uh, uh, "A shitty idea"?

355
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.999
- God damn it. - Say the vat is good.

356
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.080
- The vat is good. - Kiss the vat.

357
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.259
Do not go into that vat.

358
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.187
It appears to be full of acid.

359
00:18:56.188 --> 00:18:58.299
It is! Please, he's just a little boy!

360
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.470
- Let me talk to him. - Tell him we're very upset!

361
00:19:00.475 --> 00:19:01.884
Morty, please. Step back.

362
00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:03.479
That vat is full of acid.

363
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.799
It'll melt you completely, leaving only your bones.

364
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.519
- Goddamn it! - I'm sorry, what did you say?

365
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.649
I'm going in the vat!

366
00:19:11.403 --> 00:19:14.837
Oh! God! Aw, I blame myself!

367
00:19:14.838 --> 00:19:16.073
Oh, what a tragedy.

368
00:19:16.074 --> 00:19:18.737
This... Oh, well, he's bones now.

369
00:19:18.738 --> 00:19:20.007
I guess all debts are paid.

370
00:19:20.008 --> 00:19:21.847
Agreed. He's definitely dead.

371
00:19:21.848 --> 00:19:24.209
Why else would the bones come up?

372
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.249
While his actions were horrifying

373
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.759
and we are well within our rights to be outraged,

374
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.169
I do wonder if we bear some responsibility

375
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.459
for this young man melting himself in acid.

376
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.990
Are we here for justice... or something else?

377
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.449
"Though justice be thy plea, consider this,

378
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.539
that in the course of justice...

379
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.060
none of us should see salvation.

380
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.889
We do pray for mercy."

381
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.299
"Merchant of Venice," nice.

382
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.659
- Very cool. Lots to think about. - Vengeance is a tomb,

383
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.759
- all-encompassing... - All right, okay,

384
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.069
this isn't a poetry reading, a kid just died.

385
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.399
Everybody go home and hug your loved one or something.

386
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.339
Wait.

387
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.119
How do we know that's really acid

388
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.057
and you didn't just have someone's bones in there?

389
00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:08.657
I mean, if you're doubting if that's really acid

390
00:20:08.658 --> 00:20:10.389
and not just jacuzzi-heated Mountain Dew,

391
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.827
you're welcome to use this ladle.

392
00:20:11.828 --> 00:20:13.799
You think I'm a goddamn idiot?

393
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.883
Brought my own.

394
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.554
_

395
00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:21.719
Aah!

396
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.199
Oh, God! Oh, God no!

397
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.434
Oh, God, no! Oh, no... Huh?

398
00:20:24.435 --> 00:20:26.299
I'm acid-proof!

399
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.719
[BLEEP] all of you. [BLEEP] all of you,

400
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.899
I'm gonna be rich!

401
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.079
Here's my ass.

402
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.147
Take a good look, spank it!

403
00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:34.777
Acid proof!

404
00:20:34.778 --> 00:20:37.747
Feels like that guy had other stuff going on.

405
00:20:37.748 --> 00:20:40.109
Don't ever make fun of me again.

406
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.242
Ever!

407
00:20:42.288 --> 00:20:43.787
All right, c'mon Morty, let's go home.

408
00:20:43.788 --> 00:20:45.639
Wait, what? This... This isn't our reality?

409
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.926
What, you think I'd waste our home

410
00:20:46.928 --> 00:20:48.589
teaching you a [BLEEP] lesson?

411
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.419
I am gonna miss this place, though...

412
00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.297
Johnny Carson's still alive and on the air,

413
00:20:52.298 --> 00:20:53.667
9/11 never happened,

414
00:20:53.668 --> 00:20:55.279
and Rocky Road ice cream has peanut butter

415
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.100
- instead of marshmallows. - The fu... What?

416
00:20:57.108 --> 00:20:58.359
The marshmallows are the best part!

417
00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.639
Morty...

418
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.754
_

419
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:38.847
Our next guest, ah, gave us,

420
00:21:38.848 --> 00:21:40.517
well, actually, very little information,

421
00:21:40.518 --> 00:21:44.817
ah, besides the fact that he is, uh, impervious to acid.

422
00:21:44.818 --> 00:21:46.814
So here he is, he's here to prove it.

423
00:21:46.815 --> 00:21:47.960
Let's welcome this guy.

424
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.940
Let's do this shit!

425
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.379
Now, you're, uh... you're sure about this?

426
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.389
Eat my [BLEEP].

427
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.979
- Hoist me! - I did not know that ass

428
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.979
was on the menu.

429
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.499
Don't steal my moment!

430
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.599
- Do it! - Ah, okay,

431
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.560
then without further ado... drop him.

432
00:22:02.568 --> 00:22:03.989
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

433
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.399
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

434
00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:20.847
Looks like I'll be eating [BLEEP] flambÃ©.

435
00:22:22.688 --> 00:22:23.844
Please kill me.

436
00:22:23.845 --> 00:22:28.259
