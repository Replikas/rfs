00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.230
Hey, you kids! Don't be bad outside my store!

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.770
I keep a nice store!

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.040
Give it up, old man!

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.681
We're just cool bad kids doing young stuff! Chh!

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.860
You guys wanna do more skateboard moves?

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.560
- Which ones? - The rad ones, that's which!

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.580
How are you kids?

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.709
Did you know your grandpa's tryin' to get your attention?

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.330
Yeah, yeah, screw off, weirdo.

10
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.330
- _ - Grandson, w-w-what's that mean?

11
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.000
He's one of those cult people.

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.540
They worship some psycho named Roy

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.220
that says he's everybody's grandpa.

14
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.360
So what do you want to do today, e-eat some snacks

15
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.750
and maybe let me kiss you finally?

16
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.794
- Y'know, with my mouth and stuff? - This is going on right now.

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.350
- L-Let's go check it out. - Aw, geez.

18
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.798
C-Come on, just for fun, you know?

19
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.000
No, that's not what I'm...

20
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.120
You guys keep thinking I'm a religious leader.

21
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.429
This isn't a religion. This is actual truth.

22
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.840
I'm a scientist in real life,

23
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.100
but this isn't real life, this is a video game.

24
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.390
Y-Y-You at least understand that much, right?

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.686
This is a video game?

26
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.688
But you said I'm your grandson?

27
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.699
I'm saying everyone is.

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.070
Everyone here, everyone in this world but me.

29
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.470
You're all my grandson, your name is Morty,

30
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.529
you're stuck in a video game, and I'm here to get you out.

31
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.531
What about me? Am I your grandson?

32
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.199
I just said everyone is!

33
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.640
- Wow! - Incredible!

34
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.180
Okay, okay, but don't react like that.

35
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.580
It's not a religion. This is what is happening.

36
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.500
You and me and your sister are at an arcade

37
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.540
called Blips and Chitz.

38
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.150
It's been taken over by terrorists.

39
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.040
The power went out, the game restarted,

40
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.560
and your identity has been splintered

41
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.490
into all the non-player characters.

42
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.200
So I jacked in as Roy, that's the player character,

43
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.500
to get you, my grandson, Morty, out of the game

44
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.929
before it's over and you die.

45
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.640
Okay, question over here.

46
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.340
- Am I your grandson? - Jesus!

47
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.478
Yes! Every single one of you is one five-billionth of Morty.

48
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.780
All of you, collectively, are Morty.

49
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.279
Look, I-I don't wanna seem impatient,

50
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.259
but there's actually a lot more that we have to get done,

51
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.810
so if this is how hard it's gonna be,

52
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.100
we are in a lot of trou...

53
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.240
Summer, what?!

54
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.900
I can't do this if you keep bugging me!

55
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.850
Do you understand time dilation?

56
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.577
I'm losing a month a second out here.

57
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.520
There's an alien army shooting people.

58
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.060
- What am I doing?! - It's a small group of alien terrorists.

59
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.334
- Just do a "Die Hard." - What does that mean?

60
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.170
Sneak around, use air vents. You've never seen "Die Hard"?

61
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.340
I'm 17. No, I've never seen fucking "Die Hard"!

62
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.639
Well, neither did the guy in "Die Hard," so you're nailing it!

63
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.219
Good luck!

64
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.080
Larry...

65
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.889
No, I'm at the end of my rope with this kid,

66
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.880
I swear to God...

67
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.140
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me! - Your beautiful hair!

68
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.969
This is not a daughter's haircut!

69
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.096
I'm not a daughter, I'm a grandson.

70
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.980
Your family had a perfectly fine religion!

71
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.180
You were raised Jewish!

72
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.780
Dad, tell me anything specific about being Jewish.

73
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.850
There's a million things!

74
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.340
You go to the temple with the... the... the special hat,

75
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.990
t-the falafafluten...

76
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.460
Oh, the falafafluten?

77
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.000
Our Jewish words are gibberish

78
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.360
because we're a 14-year-old boy

79
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.260
who was raised nondenominational Christian

80
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.660
and we're in a video game!

81
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.950
I don't need to hear this schmoitenheiven!

82
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.270
Let me ask you this, little miss grandson,

83
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.020
little miss video game character.

84
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.170
If you're not my daughter, why stand in my house

85
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.770
spouting this chatschkopfka?

86
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.377
- Why even live here? - Good question.

87
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.962
There she goes! My daughter!

88
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.257
One five-billionth of a kid trapped in a video game!

89
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.509
Yeah, that and a college degree'll pay the rent!

90
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.650
What do you people want?

91
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.000
We have many interests,

92
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.880
but right now my primary one is the location.

93
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.772
Of. Your. Safe.

94
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.230
We exchange tokens for digital currency.

95
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.340
We don't have a safe.

96
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.000
Correction, what you don't have is a head.

97
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.600
Ohh!

98
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.760
Is this a weapon or a medical tool?

99
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.990
Why would you give me a gun with a laser that thin?

100
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.560
Did you hear me tell him he wouldn't have a head?

101
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.510
- He's dead, isn't he? - People die in surgery.

102
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.583
Hey! Who don't touched me?! I don't like being touched!

103
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.300
Check the hostages.

104
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.963
Make sure nobody else here is doing a "Die Hard."

105
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.420
âª Hello, hello, hello, my name is Morty âª

106
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.990
âª I'm a 14-year-old boy in a video game âª

107
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.932
- All right! Yeah! - Aw, geez!

108
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.720
Yeah. Look. I feel like every time I explain this, I lose followers,

109
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.280
but this isn't a religion.

110
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.100
And while I do have a message from a world beyond this one,

111
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.359
and I do need the entire world to hear my message,

112
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.840
what I do not need is any more songs about it.

113
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.110
Not in this genre.

114
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.700
I'm an old-school hip-hop man,

115
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.210
and no, that's not an invitation for you to try it

116
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.680
because I'm just gonna say it,

117
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.280
we're missing the mark on diversity.

118
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.157
Get down! You're all under arrest

119
00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:52.799
for being religious the wrong way!

120
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.837
It's not a religion! You know what, just shoot me.

121
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.505
You think your god makes you bulletproof?

122
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.490
There isn't even a God in the real world, you fragmented putz.

123
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.980
- There's extra no God in here. - You know what, hippie?

124
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.779
Talking like that is why you're getting shot!

125
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.889
If you kill him, the game ends and we all die.

126
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.800
- Get down, lady! - I'm not a lady.

127
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.976
And you're not a soldier.

128
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.020
We're one person, split into a lot of little pieces.

129
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.720
Y-You feel me? Dawg?

130
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.149
Y-Y-You're not gonna hurt me. You're me.

131
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.780
My name is Kevin! I'm a Marine!

132
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.499
I'm 30! I'm a little racist,

133
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.839
but my best friend is an immigrant

134
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.100
that translated for me in a generic overseas war!

135
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.260
That's not true.

136
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.830
We're 14, we like pizza and masturbation,

137
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.000
we wear a yellow shirt,

138
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.980
and we have hair that looks like a brown helmet.

139
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.460
A-And we miss our family.

140
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.780
And we're in way over our heads again.

141
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.200
- Why's this always happen, man? - I know, right?

142
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.260
Aw, geez.

143
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.700
- Aw, geez. - Come here.

144
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.200
- Aw, geez. - Come here.

145
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.717
- Aw, geez. - Aw, geez.

146
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.135
- Aw, geez. - Aw, geez.

147
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.240
Who is that?

148
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.050
Her video game name is Marta.

149
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.849
Okay. See, this I can work with.

150
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.050
"Sneak around. Crawl in some vents.

151
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.800
Do a 'Die Hard.'"

152
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.780
Oh, my God, it's disgusting!

153
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.400
Actually, it tastes really good.

154
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.970
Oh, my God, it's disgusting that it tastes good!

155
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.707
Frank, have you found him? Report.

156
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.780
Oh. Oh. Walkie talkie. That's "Die Hard."

157
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.320
- Don't have to see it to know that. - This is Jons.

158
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.255
I repeat, have you found him?

159
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.340
Breaker, breaker. Walkie talkie.

160
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.110
I got your walkie talkie. Bitch.

161
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.800
Are you doing a "Die Hard"?

162
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.480
Maybe.

163
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.860
Are... you? Also?

164
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.900
More or less.

165
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.500
And my associate, Frank?

166
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.522
Uh, your associate Frank is definitely not doing a "Die Hard."

167
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.580
You might even say he's doing a Die Easy.

168
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.580
Because I killed him and it wasn't difficult.

169
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.480
Calm yourself, Winslow.

170
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.830
Winslow!

171
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.950
Ugh.

172
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.010
It's not every day one meets a fellow "Die Hard" enthusiast, Ms....

173
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.760
- Call me "Die Hard." - Okay, Die Hard.

174
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.360
Tell me. What do you know about "Die Hard"?

175
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.280
What do you care? You writing a book about "Die Hard"?

176
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.215
As a matter of fact, I've written several.

177
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.490
Every sentient civilization across the galaxy

178
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.636
eventually develops the same myth.

179
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.720
In Centauri, it's known as "Tower Man."

180
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.350
The Orionese have their "Thornberg Cycle."

181
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.939
And in Andromeda it's called "Foolish to Have Imagined

182
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.103
You'd Be Able to Kill."

183
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.438
All of them what you'd call "Die Hard."

184
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.770
The difference being that cultures like mine

185
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.060
are aware of its importance

186
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.819
whereas I'm starting to doubt

187
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.760
you could even recall a single line.

188
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.657
Walkie talkie "Die Hard," motherfucker.

189
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.909
Aaah!

190
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:31.969
Not so long ago,

191
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.750
Grandsonism was being dismissed as a doomsday cult.

192
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.430
But since a majority of the world decided,

193
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.719
hey, you know what, we like jerking off and playing video games

194
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.379
and our sister is out there fighting terrorists,

195
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.050
major strides have been made.

196
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.700
The world is united, because the world is one 14-year-old boy, Morty.

197
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.080
But where's it all coming from? Some say Grandsonism's leader, Roy,

198
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.120
has a secret base somewhere in these mountains.

199
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.480
I-I-I couldn't find it, so I'm standing in...

200
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.420
in the general area with a microphone.

201
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.519
For Good Enough News, I'm Tony!

202
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.530
There she is, my right-hand Morty!

203
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.160
- Got enough spaceships? - Not yet.

204
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.880
I figure five more years of game time

205
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.869
before I can take the whole fake population

206
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.090
into fake outer space.

207
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.660
What do we do in outer space?

208
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.470
Nothing. It's fake. W-We keep going.

209
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.760
The game's map has edges,

210
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.700
but the game's engine will let us go past them.

211
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.200
That will force the game to reset,

212
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.173
but first it will kick us out, which Morty should survive.

213
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.341
I mean, whatever amount of Morty we have on board.

214
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.959
So if you don't have five billion handkerchiefs soaked in chloroform,

215
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.149
I hope you can keep flipping idiots to our cause.

216
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.570
They're not idiots, Grandpa.

217
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.880
- They're me. - Ha.

218
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.780
You'll know how funny that is when we get back.

219
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.200
By the way, I had your genius of a father picked up.

220
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.064
- He's over there. - What? Why?

221
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.929
I thought you'd be grateful and less distracted

222
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.260
than if I let him die.

223
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.480
He's been in real bad shape since he lost his wife...

224
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.690
- My mom? - Your not-at-all-real mom,

225
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.020
a mom in a video game.

226
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.300
Occupied by a tiny fraction of yourself.

227
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.710
A fraction of yourself which is now dead forever,

228
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.100
and fractions add up, so I had your dad brought here.

229
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.500
You're welcome, you heartless monster.

230
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.280
Marta. It's me, Dad.

231
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.700
I converted for you.

232
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.800
My name is Morty. So is yours.

233
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.140
And there's no conversion.

234
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.757
We're both Morty. It's a fact.

235
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.220
Sure, honey, anything you say. I don't want to fight.

236
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.270
I'm proud of you. Are you mad at me

237
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.359
because before you became the world's most powerful woman,

238
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.680
I shamed you for your haircut

239
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.560
and called you a slutty jobless hobo?

240
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.936
If I were you, I'd be a little mad about that.

241
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.814
You are me. A-and why would I be mad at myself?

242
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.560
Good point! Is there anything to... to eat around here?

243
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.169
There's a kitchenette in the break room.

244
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.630
Oh, a kitchenette you say. Such red carpet treatment.

245
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.460
- Excuse me? - I said thank you, I love it,

246
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.360
we... we... we're all part of Morty!

247
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.830
Some of us more important parts than others...

248
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.240
Man, the part of me that's my father is a twat.

249
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.581
That's also gonna be funny when we get back.

250
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.792
Next time you try to do a "Die Hard,"

251
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.410
don't hide under a long table like the guy from "Die Hard."

252
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.756
Okay, I won't.

253
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.059
I thought you said she doesn't know how to do a "Die Hard"!

254
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.720
- She doesn't. - She's killing us off one by one!

255
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.970
What do you expect her to do, buy us each an ice cream?

256
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.183
Two by two? She's improvising.

257
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.630
Which is how she's going to fall right into our trap.

258
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.490
I'm going to wander the arcade unarmed,

259
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.260
and when she comes across me, I'll pretend to be a hostage.

260
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.050
And because she hasn't seen "Die Hard,"

261
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.950
instead of handing me an unloaded gun,

262
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.690
she'll hand me a... ugh!

263
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.407
"Die Hard"! "Die Hard"! "Die Hard"!

264
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.900
What the hell was that?!

265
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.420
"Die Hard"! "Die Hard"!

266
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.419
You can't just keep yelling "Die Hard"

267
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.340
into a walkie talkie and... ugh!

268
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.340
She threw her walkie talkie away!

269
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.260
She hates "Die Hard"!

270
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.140
Which makes her the ultimate McClane.

271
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.300
Forget everything you know about "Die Hard"

272
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.420
and just go shoot that bitch!

273
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.012
Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Roy.

274
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.760
Half the country hangs on your every word.

275
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.360
Heck, most of the world.

276
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.434
You're, like, uh, kind of a pope, I reckon.

277
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.199
L... I'm not a pope because it's not a religion.

278
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.520
We're literally in a video game.

279
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.900
I've heard the message, Roy. You're not on the clock here.

280
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.820
So you want every single person on a spaceship.

281
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.240
But you got a bunch of holdouts.

282
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.820
Maybe people that prefer their leaders a little more elected.

283
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.360
Right. Your voters. People that like being told what to do,

284
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.741
but don't like admitting it.

285
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.829
Yeah, not sure I'd put it that way.

286
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.327
I'm sure you'd put it a stupid way.

287
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.900
I told you this was a waste of time.

288
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.220
I've got 92% of you ready to vamoose.

289
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.375
We're not gonna get the rest by making deals with parasites.

290
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.790
Mr. President, Roy is Rick.

291
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.290
He's not us. You and I, w-we're Morty.

292
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.549
Is that really so hard to believe?

293
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.080
Kid, I've known it and I've believed it longer than you have.

294
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.430
We both became video game characters at the same moment,

295
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.429
but I knew the truth before you dropped your skateboard

296
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.097
and went to your first cult meeting.

297
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.640
How do you think a guy becomes a President in this game, honey?

298
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.990
By not paying attention?

299
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Sorry to call you honey,

300
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.659
I know we're both parts of a 14-year-old boy,

301
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.273
but my part's old-fashioned and vaguely Southern.

302
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.068
I'm confused. If... If you know Rick is real, why...

303
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.695
Why hold out? Because he's a rude, entitled cock.

304
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.840
He's here to save us.

305
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.790
He... He could've left the game and let us die.

306
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.960
He's spent 50 years...

307
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.410
50 years, it's what, a couple hours to him?

308
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.290
He refuses to leave without his grandson,

309
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.900
but what's grandson mean to him?

310
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.140
Sounds like it means butler.

311
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.260
Someone to "Help Summer with her 'Die Hard,'"

312
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.340
whatever that means.

313
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.800
I'll tell you what it doesn't mean.

314
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.050
Fly fishing. A hug.

315
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.270
A little appreciation for what is clearly a pretty decent kid.

316
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.680
At least the 8% of him that makes up the decent half

317
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.845
of the greatest God damn nation on the planet.

318
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.260
We're not a person to him yet.

319
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.182
We're not Morty yet. We-We're divided.

320
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.610
We're divided because some of us doesn't trust the guy.

321
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.050
What happens to that part of us when we're all back together?

322
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.500
One Morty? Indivisible?

323
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.350
Under a cranky old bag of dicks?

324
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.650
A man you can lock in a box with five billion pieces

325
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.180
of his own God damn flesh and blood

326
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.860
for 50 God damn simulated years

327
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.640
and never hear him say "I love you"?

328
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.780
Sorry, pumpkin tits, that dog don't hunt.

329
00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.330
Wa-Want some heroin?

330
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.038
I-It's a video game, might as well.

331
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.210
Just about ready for launch, kiddo.

332
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.810
I can finally get outta these clothes.

333
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.310
I don't have nearly enough pockets.

334
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.257
And it'll be nice to have my own dick back.

335
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.310
Y-you're fine leaving 8% of me to die?

336
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.060
It's not your finest 8%, Morty.

337
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.090
And 8% of anything is expendable.

338
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.750
8% of pizza is crust.

339
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.150
8% of the Snyder Cut was Batman dreaming.

340
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.529
I don't know what that reference is!

341
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.890
- We're in a video game! - Not for long, baby!

342
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.480
I'm not leaving without all of me.

343
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.520
What? Oh, no, let me crunch these numbers.

344
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.190
8% of five billion plus one person...

345
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.930
my God, if you stay, it changes nothing! Bye.

346
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.149
If she's not going, I don't think my country wants to go.

347
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.400
Who invited you to chime in, monitor face?

348
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.953
Why give me a monitor if my opinion doesn't matter?

349
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.160
Your opinion isn't allowed to matter for the rest of us.

350
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.880
We're all a-Morty. How many chunks of us

351
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.879
- are we a-supposed to give up? - Look, I don't know about you,

352
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.250
but I was already taking a big leap of faith, here.

353
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.780
We-We're basically giving up our lives

354
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.381
to become a tiny part of a stranger...

355
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.060
- These lives aren't a-real! - Yeah, but they're longer!

356
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.553
What... What is this, suicide by summit meeting?

357
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.597
Everyone stop.

358
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.420
Rick, I'll get every single part of me

359
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.350
- to get on every ship and go with you. - Good.

360
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.440
But you have to tell us you love us.

361
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.250
I mean, at this point even if he said it,

362
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.817
what... what... what's with the pause?

363
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.152
Screw you, wait for it!

364
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.987
- Holy war! - Holier war!

365
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.510
Holiest war ever!

366
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.914
Loyalist Evacucratic Grandsonistas

367
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.480
claimed seven new cities today,

368
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.990
while the Stayputlican Contrasurgent Confederation

369
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.628
of Dedication to Video Game Reality

370
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.940
invaded the territories of Mortopia,

371
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.965
New South Saint Morty, and Wemortyall.

372
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.170
In the end, what does it matter, everyone's Morty,

373
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.109
nobody wants to die, and that's a hell of a reason

374
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.920
to kill yourself, but what can we do?

375
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.930
Aw, geez.

376
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.290
You know you're my grandson and none of this is real!

377
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.020
What are you trying to achieve? You're only hurting yourself!

378
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.800
The only reason any of us matter is we're pieces of Morty!

379
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.119
You taught us that, Rick.

380
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.788
But you also taught us you don't care about Morty.

381
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.880
Here's how much I care.

382
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.251
If you don't stop blowing up my flying saucers,

383
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.270
I will exterminate every last one of you!

384
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.587
Anything it takes!

385
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.040
What do I have to say? I love and respect you, okay?

386
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.480
Too late for talk, Rick.

387
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.360
A robot. Of course.

388
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.920
I'm not gonna risk dying because if I die in the game,

389
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.760
you go brain dead, you're welcome!

390
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.960
Better to die in Roy than to serve in hell!

391
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.390
And what about Summer? Do... Do you not care about her?

392
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.240
We gotta get back, Morty. We gotta help her.

393
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.520
You know what, wherever she is,

394
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.490
I'm sure she's doing fine without your help.

395
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.903
Woof, jinx, anyone?

396
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.560
Should we finish the job, b-blow the place?

397
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.900
No, this can't end, not like this.

398
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.320
Do you think I jinxed her?

399
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.440
Why aren't you shooting higher?

400
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.376
I don't wanna shoot the glass. Because...

401
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.060
You don't have to not do things that were done in "Die Hard."

402
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.080
You can shoot the glass. Shoot the glass!

403
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.910
Throw grenades! Do everything!

404
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.010
Just kill her!

405
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.510
Why are you here, Miss Die Hard?

406
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.479
I want to know why you don't just leave.

407
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.679
- "Die Hard"! - Aw, geez.

408
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.849
- Wait. Shh. Shh. - We get every single person

409
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.317
on a spaceship, and then what?

410
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.640
And then we help your sister do her "Die Hard."

411
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.661
- Too much. It's too much. - Ooh, sorry.

412
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.540
I've got a special guest with me, Ms. Die Hard!

413
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.210
Or should I call you... this guy's sister?

414
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.460
- Mom. - Hello, dear.

415
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.221
- I'm joining the other side. - What? Why?

416
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.930
I wanna live in the real world with Roy.

417
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.700
I wanna help Summer with her Die Hard."

418
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.060
His name is Rick.

419
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.209
And we have no way of knowing

420
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.812
if your generation is actually part of Morty.

421
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.523
Do you know how offensive that is?

422
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.220
It's parenting like this that pushed me into religious radicalism.

423
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.320
- Bye. - It's not...

424
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.380
Not a religion. But okay.

425
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.620
Ma'am, it's really not safe out here.

426
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.493
Also, it's... time.

427
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.580
Are we going on the spaceship now?

428
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.125
Pretty soon, Dad. Yeah.

429
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.710
Are you... lying?

430
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.549
You kind of said it with that tone in your voice

431
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.380
that we use for dying people.

432
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.000
I won't lie to you. You're dying, Dad.

433
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.180
And we're... not leaving the video game.

434
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.929
We're... We're gonna live our lives out here.

435
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.250
What? Why the fuck?!

436
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.980
- Why? - It's more real here.

437
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
The hell it is! My liver hurts!

438
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.160
I'm old here!

439
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.790
I wanna be a teenage boy!

440
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.460
I want to jump around and do homework

441
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.110
and jerk off all over the place.

442
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.130
But, Dad, that's...

443
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.060
We would've been one tiny part of that.

444
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.363
In here, we get to be who we really are.

445
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.720
Yeah. Great. Dead.

446
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.340
I get to be a dead father.

447
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.770
Who do I make the...

448
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.060
Who do I...

449
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.520
- Who... - Don't talk, Dad.

450
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.360
- Gotta finish my zinger. - You don't.

451
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.740
Who do... Who do...

452
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.140
Who do I make the check out to?

453
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.650
"Best Daughter Ever... Incorporated"?

454
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.022
Thought you woulda left by now.

455
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.190
I was hoping to get at least half of you home.

456
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.299
I can't hold out much longer.

457
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.278
I-I'm pretty much beating my heart voluntarily at this point.

458
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.560
Okay, this is a little awkward,

459
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.500
but the time dilation has given me a chance to reflect.

460
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.640
And I-I-I gotta say...

461
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.040
There's no need for that.

462
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.320
I've come to tell you, I'm giving the go-ahead.

463
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.020
All of Morty will leave with you.

464
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.140
To the real world.

465
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.680
To be your grandson,

466
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.800
may we help Summer do her "Die Hard."

467
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.670
I-I gotta say, I-I was not expecting that.

468
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.220
W-Why the change of heart?

469
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.000
My people are staying only out of loyalty to me.

470
00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.200
I'm a relic.

471
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.846
I don't represent them anymore.

472
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.920
You really are a good grandson, you know that?

473
00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.160
- I'm proud of you, Morty. - Please, call me Marta.

474
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.812
That's my video game name.

475
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.650
Speaking of which, I do have one condition.

476
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.840
I must say I admire you, Ms. Die Hard.

477
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.660
You were a genuine McClane...

478
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.240
a most worthy Yankee doodle ruffian.

479
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.520
But now it's all come to an end.

480
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.997
And the quarterback, as they say, is toast.

481
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.541
I don't suppose you have a gun taped to your back.

482
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.629
What the hell does that mean?

483
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.170
It's how "Die Hard" ends. Doesn't matter now.

484
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.900
"Die Hard" tapes a gun to his back?

485
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.599
That's the end of your perfect movie

486
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.000
that you've patterned your whole criminal life after?

487
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.080
Well, it seems to have worked out pretty well for me

488
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.280
since you're the one about to die.

489
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.480
What was it you said? Ah, yes.

490
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.310
"Walkie talkie 'Die Hard,' motherfucker."

491
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.640
- Why are you laughing? - Well, it's funny.

492
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.440
The way you said motherfucker.

493
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.200
- Just laughing. - Okay. It's just that...

494
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.010
Oh, does that happen in "Die Hard"?

495
00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.140
Does John McClane laugh,

496
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.620
and then Hans Gruber is confused,

497
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.289
but then they start laughing together for a second?

498
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.420
That actually does happen, yes!

499
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.169
Wait. You knew their names this whole time?

500
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.630
Not this whole time, no.

501
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.919
You left your book in the bathroom.

502
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.120
I read it while I took a shit. I mean, mostly the ending.

503
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.637
Yiiiiiiiiiii...

504
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.101
... ippppppeeeeeeeee...

505
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.731
- Oh. - ... dippee doo, baby!

506
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.110
Nice timing, Grandpa Rick!

507
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.447
Tochter aus Elysium...

508
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.480
- Uh... - Hi, remember me?

509
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.950
You shot me on that table,

510
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.000
and the near-death experience got me reflecting.

511
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.490
I didn't used to be like this.

512
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.440
I-I... uh, ate a kid.

513
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.660
It was dark, and I thought he was a grown-up.

514
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.100
Ever since then, I haven't eaten anybody at all.

515
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.439
I think I was channeling all that pent-up eating energy

516
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.134
into this job. But now...

517
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.760
Thank you for freeing me.

518
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.560
Classic "Tower Man."

519
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.410
Almost too on the nose. Right, Morty?

520
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.605
Sure. I mean, whatever you say, Rick.

521
00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.775
Y-You know best! I trust you implicitly.

522
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.610
- Is he all right? - Oh, yeah, he's fine.

523
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.863
Got him all out, every last piece.

524
00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.690
What's with the jacked-up "Roy" machine?

525
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.320
Shouldn't you be taking that to repairs?

526
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.510
Nah, special order.

527
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.340
Some rich douche wants his last game to keep running.

528
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.049
Hooked it up to an external battery. We're just supposed to store it.

529
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.480
- Weird. - Yeah, and get this.

530
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.660
The game's still going, but Roy's dead.

531
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.000
- What? - Yeah, he's just a corpse

532
00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.500
floating at the edge of outer space,

533
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.510
but for some reason the game won't restart

534
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.180
'cause it's centered on some old lady living a full life.

535
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.721
Hmm. Sounds bad.

536
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.420
Well, put it in there.

537
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.750
Hey, is anybody that wants this later gonna be able to...

538
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.420
Huh? Oh, yeah, everything's cataloged and tracked.

539
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.660
People got the wrong idea from the size of the space,

540
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.010
but it's all supported digitally.

541
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.180
So I can put it anywhere.

542
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.782
- Here's fine? - That's as fine as anywhere else!

543
00:21:56.899 --> 00:22:00.069
_

544
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.160
Why isn't anyone attacking him?

545
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.460
It's fucking freezing out.

546
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.140
No, I think it's the sign.

547
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.460
Well, the sign from "Die Hard 3" was clearly racist.

548
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.780
Obviously. But I think we went too broad.

549
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.860
"Everybody"? I mean, who is that offending?

550
00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.380
Everybody?

551
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.540
At this point, why even do it?

552
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.049
I wish my brother was still alive.
