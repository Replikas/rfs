WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.280
C'mon, Rick.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.680
- We're... We're almost there. - Ugh, leave me, Morty.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.811
It's the only way.

4
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.400
Wha... Were... Wha... Were we...

5
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.558
Were we Blades in that one? That's [BLEEP] tight.

6
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.090
Just stay with me.

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.754
I'm... I'm scared, Morty. I can see the end.

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.889
I'm a silly man. I'm a silly small man.

9
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.609
I'm... I'm sorry I got you into this.

10
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.261
Then how about I get us outta this?

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.440
- Hello? - Hey, Jessica.

12
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.060
I-It's Morty. From school.

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.513
Oh, hey, Morty. What's up?

14
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.440
Um, I just want to say that you're really great.

15
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.319
I know the timing never really worked out with us,

16
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.629
but you're really great and I wish I got to know you better.

17
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.321
Oh, I mean... That's a lot.

18
00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:49.322
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, I guess I just...

19
00:00:49.323 --> 00:00:51.425
No, I just wish you said it sooner.

20
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.740
- Wh-What? - Yeah, I mean, being nervous

21
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.259
is sort of selfish sometimes, y'know?

22
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.929
- Life support systems failing. - Yeah, that's a great point.

23
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.200
- Well, what are you doing tonight? - Tonight?

24
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.535
Yeah. Do you, like, want to watch a movie or something?

25
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.918
Um, yeah. Tonight. Sounds great.

26
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.007
Holy [BLEEP]. Holy [BLEEP]. Come on, come on!

27
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.640
Oh.

28
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.628
- Where are we? - We're home, Rick.

29
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.098
I-I landed us in the ocean.

30
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140
The ocean?! The ocean on Earth?!

31
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.180
- Uh, yeah, I-I guess so. - Oh, [BLEEP].

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.580
Holy [BLEEP]. We have to go.

33
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.890
We have to go right [BLEEP] now.

34
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.139
- What? - You touched the ocean, Morty.

35
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.496
- What's the big... What? - Oh, [BLEEP] [BLEEP].

36
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.229
Richard!

37
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.720
You have desecrated the sacred treaty

38
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.640
betwixt land and sea.

39
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.020
Now face the wrath of your once and eternal foe...

40
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.300
- Mr. Nimbus! - Sorry. Who is that?

41
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.380
- My nemesis. - What?

42
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.980
My [BLEEP] nemesis, okay?

43
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.415
Okay, but what was his name again?

44
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.500
I am Mr. Nimbus!

45
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.985
He's gonna say that a lot.

46
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
W-Wait, so who is coming over again?

47
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.000
- He said his nemesis? - Rick has a nemesis?

48
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.720
- I guess. - Has he mentioned him before?

49
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.720
I-I was gonna ask you. First I'm hearing it.

50
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.700
Who is he? Like a magic guy?

51
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.095
Rick's science and he's magic?

52
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.820
He's like a-a fish?

53
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.920
- A fish. - He's not a fish. He's Mr. Nimbus.

54
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.848
He's king of the ocean and he's a piece of [BLEEP].

55
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.060
Are you happy, Morty?

56
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.319
Are you happy you touched the ocean?

57
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.519
He's gonna be here any minute.

58
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.680
Just help me smooth this over

59
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.779
or this guy's gonna become more trouble than he's worth.

60
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.240
Um, hey, I don't know how much I can help out tonight, Rick.

61
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.859
Jessica's coming over j-just to, like, watch a movie or something,

62
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.660
but y'know, t-t-that's a good step.

63
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.929
That's a solid step to something, y'know?

64
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.328
Truly nobody cares about your [BLEEP], Morty.

65
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.499
The sooner you learn that, the better.

66
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.599
I think you just don't want me happy

67
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.490
'cause then I'll stop doing your crazy chores.

68
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.990
Trust me, after that ocean [BLEEP]up,

69
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.579
you don't get to do anything crazy.

70
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.659
While I bull[BLEEP] my way through this peace summit treaty

71
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.378
with Nimbus, Summer is gonna dive into the Marianas Trench

72
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.539
to recover the forbidden shell that gives him his power

73
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.302
because Summer can be trusted.

74
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.437
Let's lick [BLEEP].

75
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.471
- Okay, what? - I don't love that.

76
00:03:18.472 --> 00:03:20.589
Of course you don't, 'cause you guys aren't getting any.

77
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.418
Actually, your father and I

78
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.078
have been very sex-positive lately.

79
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.780
- Eww. - Dr. Wong suggested we experiment.

80
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.358
We've been watching pornography. Together.

81
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.649
- Gross! - I might never come back

82
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.669
- from the ocean. - Oh, you'll have to tone it down, babe.

83
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.900
The squares can't handle it.

84
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.080
There are suicide capsules in all of your teeth.

85
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.339
Do what you want with that. C'mon, Morty. You're on booze duty.

86
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.340
Okay, Nimbus only drinks the good [BLEEP].

87
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.859
So just toss this whale-ass ocean-wine in here

88
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.300
and age it up a few centuries.

89
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.780
So time moves faster in there?

90
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.202
I-I-Is it like a Narnia thing?

91
00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:51.978
I'm not a beaver who believes in Jesus Christ, Morty.

92
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.869
But yeah, it's pretty much a Narnia thing.

93
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.319
- Okay, but Jessica... - All you have to do

94
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.588
is bring wine, Morty.

95
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.529
- When do I ask you for anything? - When do you...

96
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.940
I haven't been to a full week of school in years!

97
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.680
I don't know shit! And for what?

98
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.039
How many enemies do you have to have?

99
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.439
Why is everything a fight with you?

100
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.919
You might want to learn this early, Morty.

101
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.800
- Life is a fight. - With Mr. Nimbus?

102
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.960
Are you makin' fun of me?

103
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.392
Mr. Nimbus is an ice-cold dick killer, Morty.

104
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.820
Okay, let's go.

105
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.695
That's his magic ocean horn.

106
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.830
Is that Mr. Nimbus?

107
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.520
- Nimbus. - Richard.

108
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.573
You look like ass.

109
00:04:26.574 --> 00:04:28.318
Let's get this over with.

110
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.209
- I'm sorry. This is the guy? - Jerry.

111
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.480
Hold on. No. I've seen you [BLEEP] a planet,

112
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.940
and this is the guy you're afraid of?

113
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.580
I like this one, Rick.

114
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.740
He is unbroken. Untamed.

115
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.240
Perhaps he could use a firmer grip upon his leash.

116
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.099
Okay, that's enough. I'm calling the police.

117
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.109
- Go ahead. - Jerry.

118
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.460
- I will! - Good. I control them.

119
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.740
- Excuse me? - He controls police, Jerry.

120
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.040
Right, that tracks.

121
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.940
In Dumb World. Police?

122
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.300
A strange horny ocean man is on my lawn.

123
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.571
Well, I don't see how that's relevant, but we're white.

124
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.360
Freeze!

125
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.409
Fight.

126
00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:06.078
[BLEEP]

127
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.279
Flee.

128
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.600
Let's get outta here.

129
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.700
- Shall we, Richard? - Okay, but how did he...

130
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.340
Jesus Christ, Jerry. He's Mr. Nimbus.

131
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.700
- He controls the police! - Um, hello?

132
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.780
Am I in the right place?

133
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.228
I just saw a bunch of cops having sex with each other?

134
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.029
Hi! Jessica! Hi! Yeah, yup, y-you're in the right spot.

135
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.400
Uh, everyone, th-this is Jessica.

136
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.633
This is everybody. Uh, this is...

137
00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:29.680
- I am Mr. Nimbus. - Jesus, Nimbus, just get inside.

138
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.804
Morty, grab the wine.

139
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.772
Yeah, in a minute. C-C'mon, Jessica.

140
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.140
Stand aside.

141
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.358
Unless you are worthy of Nimbus.

142
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.180
If that means what I think it means,

143
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.640
I'll have you know, we watch porn together.

144
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.540
- Oh! - Ooh!

145
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.889
Wow, okay! Looks like you guys just got the nod.

146
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.899
The nod?

147
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.880
Mr. Nimbus has a sense for these things.

148
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.740
I take it you're a sex-positive couple?

149
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.660
Oh, yeah. Very much so.

150
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.859
- We watch porn together. - Great!

151
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.880
I'll mark you down as eligible for a threeway.

152
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.319
Here's all the information you'll need.

153
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.001
The king of the ocean wants to have a threesome with us?

154
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.060
Totally optional.

155
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.920
But a remarkable option to have, I assure you. Very jealous.

156
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.230
There's a form on the last page

157
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.769
so we know where to send the gift basket.

158
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.200
So that just happened.

159
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.660
You don't sound upset about it.

160
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.158
Neither do you.

161
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.640
Oh, my God. Is this happening? To us?

162
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.340
I thought this only happened in New York or on HBO.

163
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.740
- Dr. Wong hasn't been wrong yet. - You're right.

164
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.124
This is exactly what she was talking about.

165
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.420
So, uh, yeah. J-Just make yourself comfortable.

166
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.400
Y'know, ch-choose a movie or... or we can watch

167
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.839
some interdimensional cable if you want.

168
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.100
We now return to "Nintendo 69."

169
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.860
Nintendo, oh, what are you doing to me?

170
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.678
Oh, Nintendo, oh, Nin...

171
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.360
Or we can watch whatever, y'know.

172
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.438
Wh-Whatever you're into.

173
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.560
Morty, did I hear you're getting wine?

174
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.000
Yeah, I gotta get some wine for Mr. Nimbus.

175
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.688
- Got any extra? - Oh. Uh, yeah.

176
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.148
- Yeah, yeah, I'll go get some, just for you. - Cool.

177
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.783
Hurry back.

178
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.021
- Looks like you could use a hand. - Oh, hey!

179
00:06:56.022 --> 00:06:57.980
- Yeah, th-th-that'd be great. - No problem.

180
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.161
- Hoovy? Dinner's ready! - Be right there, sugar hoof!

181
00:07:01.162 --> 00:07:03.180
Just helping this young man through a portal

182
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.780
with that crate full of alcohol that's been here for decades.

183
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.300
Hey, thanks, Hoovy. I-I really appreciate that.

184
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.620
I-I got a girl over, and I really, really like her.

185
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.000
- I-I'm just nervous. - Oh, I know that feeling.

186
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.640
When I first started seeing Bova,

187
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.679
I could only think about all the ways I was gonna mess it up.

188
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.260
- So what'd you do? - Oh, I messed it up.

189
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.360
But I found the one who loves me for that.

190
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.340
Thanks. I-I really needed to hear that.

191
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.600
- Here, t-take one of these. - Oh, you don't have to.

192
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.980
No, I-I want to.

193
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.100
You have a good day, Hoovy.

194
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.160
You have a great time with that lady up there.

195
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.595
- Just relax. - Will do!

196
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.059
Bova?

197
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.936
Why did you leave us, Father?

198
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.205
Japheth? When were you born?

199
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.699
I swore to Mother if I ever met you,

200
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.710
I'd avenge her.

201
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.480
It wasn't my fault.

202
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.960
Whose, then? Whose?!

203
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.015
The boy from the magic door.

204
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.668
- Shall we discuss terms? - Yeah, fine. Whatever. Terms.

205
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.955
Term number one...

206
00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:03.760
I am King of the Ocean.

207
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.280
The place I shit? Go ahead.

208
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.420
Term number two...

209
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.808
Stop shitting in the ocean.

210
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.199
No idea what you're talking about.

211
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.460
Delicious. Another.

212
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.599
Oh, uh, well, I-I was thinking of using this one for...

213
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.020
Morty, just give him the bottle. God damn.

214
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.038
Another!

215
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.906
Morty, you get the wine?

216
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.200
Hey, Jessica. Um, yeah, sorry.

217
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.109
I just... just going back to get it.

218
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.779
Oh. I thought you already went.

219
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.120
I did! I just... just got a little busy.

220
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.760
Going right now, again!

221
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.099
You go ahead and fire up that movie!

222
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.040
That's okay. I'll wait for you.

223
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.440
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!

224
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.580
I've been waiting for you.

225
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.329
- Oh, wow. Hoovy, right? - Never say his name!

226
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.174
Jesus Christ! Why...

227
00:08:46.175 --> 00:08:48.334
Why is every old guy super jacked?

228
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.070
Sorry! I'm sorry! I-I just need the wine!

229
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.104
I'm sorry! Stop it!

230
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.974
- [BLEEP] kill you! - Ow! Okay, screw this!

231
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.340
You know what?

232
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.660
- You! - Yeah, [BLEEP] you, Hoovy!

233
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.117
Father?

234
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.829
- It's him! I told you he'd come back! - Holy [BLEEP].

235
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.355
Okay, look, he wasn't old like 10 seconds ago.

236
00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:12.525
Ow! Mother[BLEEP]!

237
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.629
I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry we never believed.

238
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.780
He'll come back. Stop him.

239
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.080
Stop him.

240
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.680
Papa, why do we guard the gate?

241
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.150
Because one day, the dark child shall return.

242
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.286
And we will be ready.

243
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.400
Delicious.

244
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.525
Where is your wine boy, Richard? I thirst.

245
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.619
He's getting it. Stop eating beignets like that.

246
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.180
Participant voids all liability

247
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.233
in the event of death by orgasm?

248
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.680
Are we really ready to open things this wide?

249
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.839
What if it gets weird? What if I fall in love with him?

250
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.906
No, no, no, no, no. Damn it!

251
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.020
What was that?

252
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.760
Another scheme of yours, Richard?

253
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.340
I know you're planning something.

254
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.180
It's nothing. Will you excuse me, please?

255
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.060
What the [BLEEP] is going on? Where's the wine?

256
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.583
Dad was horny and I dropped it.

257
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.150
God, I can't... I can't believe you're [BLEEP] this up.

258
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:14.185
I'm not [BLEEP] it up! There was a guy in the thing and...

259
00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:15.439
There's always a guy in a thing!

260
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.893
Land dwellers do not keep Nimbus waiting and live.

261
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.560
Be right out! Goddammit.

262
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.389
Do you see this whisper kitchen "Frasier" bull[BLEEP]

263
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.119
you're making me do? Morty, just get the wine.

264
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.799
Beth and Jerry, stop trying to [BLEEP] Nimbus.

265
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.102
- Well, we wouldn't do it here. - I'll have you know he propositioned us.

266
00:10:29.103 --> 00:10:31.069
He propositions everybody!

267
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.360
Hey, hey, hey, Jessica.

268
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.120
- W-What's up? - Seems like you're busy.

269
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.860
No, no, no! I ran into a little trouble.

270
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.699
But... But... But I'll go get that wine right now.

271
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.780
But you said were going to get it like twice already.

272
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.200
I-I-I was and I-I'm getting it right now.

273
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.440
Holy [BLEEP], it's him!

274
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.860
God damn it! What do you want me to say?!

275
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.559
I-I'm sorry!

276
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.820
We finally beat him.

277
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.719
But let's always remain vigilant

278
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.200
because you never know.

279
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.869
He might be back one day.

280
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.629
Okay, Narnia! Let's go.

281
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.369
Let's [BLEEP] go!

282
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.569
It is over.

283
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.242
The boy is not coming back.

284
00:11:09.243 --> 00:11:10.944
He always comes back.

285
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.660
You have wasted our lives,

286
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.480
our very futures, on a fantasy!

287
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:17.379
- A lie! - I know what I saw.

288
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.585
You saw nothing!

289
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.279
You are a foolish boy!

290
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.198
Those called fools

291
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.429
are the only ones brave enough to see the truth.

292
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.909
Tell me, Father. Am I a fool now?

293
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.340
I was born in the pits that made these stones.

294
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.300
I lost my years building a temple to a lie.

295
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.720
So I made lies my power.

296
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.699
- And what is power but a lie we... - Aah!

297
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.400
Oh, [BLEEP], he's real!

298
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.080
He's real! I was wrong!

299
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.472
I was so wrong! God is real!

300
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.540
_

301
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.000
Wow. Impeccable service.

302
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.399
- Big tip. - I liked your other one more.

303
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.000
What was his name? Kyle?

304
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.160
- What? - Nothing.

305
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.949
Can we just sign this thing and go?

306
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.799
Jessica, I-I'm so sorry.

307
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.772
I mean, it's fine. You were only gone like a couple minutes.

308
00:12:46.773 --> 00:12:48.041
Morty, are you okay?

309
00:12:48.042 --> 00:12:49.820
I'm... I'm sorry, Jessica.

310
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.480
We just never seem to get it right, do we?

311
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.440
No, I guess we don't.

312
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.920
But I'm glad you called me.

313
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.040
Maybe we can start over, get it right this time.

314
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.810
Yeah. I'd... I'd like that.

315
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.122
Thanks for bringing the wine.

316
00:13:03.123 --> 00:13:04.657
Totally worth it.

317
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.559
- Do we need an opener? - Oh. I'll... I'll... I'll go get it.

318
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.028
Mmm.

319
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.080
I do so love to sign upon the dotted line.

320
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.120
- Shall we? - Jesus Christ, yes.

321
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.320
And who is your witness?

322
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.840
My witness is the squid.

323
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.639
Really proud of this SeaWorld theme, aren't you?

324
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.689
Hey, just get a witness, man. Don't make this about me.

325
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.640
Or perhaps Richard has no one

326
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.600
with whom he can trust his life.

327
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.140
Who truly knows him.

328
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.380
- Save me. - Fine!

329
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.360
I'll get someone. Oh, my God. Morty! C'mere.

330
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.300
- I need you for some bull[BLEEP]. - Look, Rick,

331
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.439
I've done everything you've asked.

332
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.359
Now can I just have some time with my girlfriend?

333
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.660
- Your girlfriend? - I mean, she's not...

334
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.760
we kissed,

335
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.020
but I'm just trying to take it slow.

336
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.080
You gotta give these things time to breathe, y'know?

337
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.768
Do you know why you're special, Adam?

338
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.960
- Because I am The Traveler? - Yes.

339
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.373
You will be the one to pass through the door.

340
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.880
You will be the one to end our pain.

341
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.009
But, Mother, what about my pain?

342
00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.540
Your pain shall set us free.

343
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.014
It is time to begin.

344
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.579
Again.

345
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.589
Again!

346
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.928
- You are not ready. - Please, Mother...

347
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.900
Do you think he will show you mercy?

348
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.733
Like he did to us? Again!

349
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.610
Does anyone need anything?

350
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.400
Does Nimbus need anything?

351
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.660
- Holy [BLEEP]. - Don't judge.

352
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.520
- We're growing as a couple! - Aah!

353
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.040
Why is this happening to me?!

354
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.790
For the future!

355
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.899
You dare assassinate Nimbus?

356
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.408
- Sorry. Wait. Who... Who is that? - Get in line, pal!

357
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.118
- Such a waste. - M-Mother?

358
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.188
Aah!

359
00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.782
Jessica!

360
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.280
You just had to touch the ocean.

361
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.740
Aaah! Shut up!

362
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.019
There isn't time to...

363
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.170
It's all [BLEEP] and you [BLEEP] it!

364
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.780
- Huh? - You're early.

365
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.540
W-What is this place?

366
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.320
The end. But also a beginning.

367
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.619
- Isn't every end a beginning? - Stay back!

368
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.040
I don't want your stripped down Sundance sci-fi bullshit.

369
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.920
- Where's Jessica? - Jessica.

370
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.840
That was her name, wasn't it?

371
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.699
Thank you, Morty. I had forgotten.

372
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.514
Oh, right.

373
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.809
You'll be needing this.

374
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.685
For the wine.

375
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.060
Oh, [BLEEP], we got him!

376
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.760
Can you believe he bought that [BLEEP] tree bull[BLEEP]?

377
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.020
We [BLEEP] got him!

378
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.180
Very well.

379
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.239
If you seek war with Atlantis, you shall have it.

380
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.999
Oh, I've already been to war with Atlantis

381
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.448
when I D-Day'd that Mermaid [BLEEP].

382
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.719
I knew that was you!

383
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.618
Prepare my exit parade!

384
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.375
Say goodbye to your precious dry land!

385
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.480
For soon it will be wet! Wet!

386
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.740
Yeah, global warming is already doing that, asshole.

387
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.200
But sure, yeah, go for it. Make us slightly more wet!

388
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.914
- Am I a joke to you? - Yes, you are a [BLEEP] joke!

389
00:16:18.915 --> 00:16:20.960
You [BLEEP] suck! You've always sucked!

390
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.960
Y-Y-Y know why we haven't fought in years?

391
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.339
'Cause you're an embarrassment to me and I don't need you anymore.

392
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.059
I don't need anybody. All I do is eat [BLEEP]

393
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.660
and 69 Nintendos, bro.

394
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.260
- Every day. - Or maybe you hate me

395
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.840
because I am the only man to see how far you have fallen.

396
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.420
I used to fear you. Respect you.

397
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.148
Now all that's left is pity...

398
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.420
for a sad, drunk shell of a man

399
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.008
too afraid to see how alone he truly is.

400
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.520
If Diane were alive today, what would she think...

401
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.959
Don't [BLEEP] establish canonical backstory with me, you Red Lob...

402
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.540
Oh, good. You're awake.

403
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.520
I just took some wine! I said I was sorry.

404
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.129
What the [BLEEP] is wrong with you people?!

405
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.440
I have been asking that for centuries.

406
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.400
I was created to study you, Morty, to know you.

407
00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.680
But the closer I looked,

408
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.719
the more I do not recognize myself.

409
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.720
Uh, yeah, man, I really don't have time for...

410
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.478
I have often wondered who would we be without you, Morty?

411
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.734
Are we anything beyond our hatred?

412
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.770
And when she came,

413
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.938
I thought she would be the answer.

414
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.348
Frozen in time. Forever asleep.

415
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.380
We could not understand her purpose, so we hid her away.

416
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.160
Why do we always hide the truths we fear?

417
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.339
I don't give a [BLEEP], nerd!

418
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.820
- Let her go! - Why... Why did I clone myself genitals?

419
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.259
- Ow! Ooh! - I don't care, bitch! Do it!

420
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.240
- Asshole! - Yeah, guess I am an asshole!

421
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.980
Y'know, sometimes you gotta be an asshole!

422
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.423
- My grandpa taught me that! - Okay, okay, okay, fine!

423
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.920
- Morty? - Hey, Jessica.

424
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.080
Wow. Must've been some nap, huh?

425
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.500
I-Is that ooze or... I'm not sure what to call it.

426
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.040
It l-l-looks like ooze.

427
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.102
Okay. W-We can catch up later.

428
00:17:49.508 --> 00:17:51.277
What the...

429
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.329
Rick! Rick!

430
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.699
- ... obster mother[BLEEP]. - Rick!

431
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.379
- Screw this. What am I even doing? - Help!

432
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.118
Where are you?

433
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.160
Come back here.

434
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.921
I'm going to make the land wet!

435
00:18:01.922 --> 00:18:03.680
Y'know what, I'd love to see it.

436
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.360
Do it! God, do anything!

437
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.793
Just don't use me as an excuse anymore!

438
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:08.899
Rick!

439
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.560
Wow. That was intense.

440
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.740
You look stressed.

441
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.140
- We signed the paperwork. - I must go.

442
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.199
Well, your people have our number!

443
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.037
Your starfish mentioned some kind of basket?

444
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.219
- Jesus, Morty. - Stop! No, no!

445
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.199
- Not today! You don't get to... - Can't you go one day without...

446
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.876
- What the... - I [BLEEP] it up, okay?

447
00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.720
It's okay, Morty. That's what you do.

448
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.014
Now lemme Deus Ex Machina this [BLEEP] and let's go home.

449
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.684
God, why does everyone go Cyber-Punk Bird?

450
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.852
So [BLEEP] hack.

451
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.880
Oh, [BLEEP]. Well, that's cool.

452
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.866
Okay, we might be a little [BLEEP].

453
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.280
Did you think I would let you die alone, Richard?

454
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.298
I am Mr. Nimbus!

455
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.220
Wow. Phew.

456
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.138
You... You still got time for that movie?

457
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.098
Yes. Time.

458
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.067
I had nothing but time.

459
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.601
Endless time.

460
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.318
At first, it was madness. Then enlightenment.

461
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.818
Then madness again.

462
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.480
But perhaps it was a gift.

463
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.518
I could see the life of time.

464
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.628
And as I watched the life of time

465
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.120
in all its fleeting, terrible light,

466
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.118
I wondered, had I lived?

467
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.520
Was I just the object in another's story?

468
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.400
Was that all I ever was? Could I be more?

469
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.460
I had nothing but time and still no answer.

470
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.595
Time without purpose is a prison.

471
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.200
I have glimpsed into the mind of eternity.

472
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.820
Perhaps the mind of God.

473
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.820
And found nothing but silence.

474
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.370
I think we should just be friends.

475
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.848
Oh, yeah. I-I-I get that.

476
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.709
Guess we missed our moment.

477
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.188
Yes. But there will be more.

478
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.488
For both of us.

479
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.060
Goodbye, Morty.

480
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.259
- Hey, how's it going? - [BLEEP] off! I'm a Time-god!

481
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.569
Fighting by your side again, Richard.

482
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.055
- It was, uh... - Yeah.

483
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.780
Then there is no treaty.

484
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.094
Because there is no war.

485
00:20:19.095 --> 00:20:21.660
Aw, Nimbus. That's... That's really chill of you, man.

486
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.978
Richard. Before you were my greatest enemy,

487
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.900
you were my only friend.

488
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.319
- Grandpa, I got the shell! - [BLEEP]

489
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.578
- Okay, Nimbus, look. - You son of a bitch!

490
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.279
- Betrayal! - My weapons, Morty!

491
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.760
- I-I-I used them all! - Grandpa!

492
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.900
Wait, Grandpa, what do I do?

493
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.460
I have the shell. Should I blow it?

494
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.659
Is that... I'm... I'm just gonna blow it!

495
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.939
Don't blow it! Destroy the horn!

496
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.179
- What the hell, Summer?! - You were supposed to destroy the horn!

497
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.580
How was I supposed to know that?

498
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.850
Police!

499
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.122
Take this piece of [BLEEP] to jail.

500
00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:54.259
I told, ugh, I told you. He's an ice-cold dick killer!

501
00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.378
Nimbus!

502
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.778
Wait. So how can he...

503
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.708
Jesus, Summer. He's Mr. Nimbus.

504
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.333
He controls the police!

505
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.360
Jer, I think more than one safe word

506
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.460
sort of defeats the point.

507
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.680
I know, I just wanna make sure

508
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.540
we have every opportunity to stop.

509
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.440
- Super excited about it though. - Me too, so excited.

510
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.200
Jerry, are we doing this because we both want this?

511
00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.880
Or because it's what we think the other one wants?

512
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.740
I just wanted to prove that I love you so much

513
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.600
- I would do this for you! - Same!

514
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.779
Let's take that prize and get out

515
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.921
before we make a huge mistake.

516
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.138
Getting cold feet?

517
00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.338
No.

518
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.608
- Please don't tell Rick. - He wouldn't understand.

519
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.029
Yes, he would.
