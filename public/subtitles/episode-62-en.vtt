00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.899
Any clue when our houseguest is finally gonna leave?

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.629
It'd be nice to have the living room back.

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.160
I keep tripping on all his top hats.

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.839
He's always messing with my TiVo!

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.220
It's an antique, the buttons are fragile!

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.020
Big surprise that Dad's avoiding all this.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.630
Guys, he's a family friend.

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.300
He can stay as long as he needs.

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.149
Hey, so I just sold some drugs

10
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.560
to the weird little dude in there.

11
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.980
He said you had cash?

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.387
Oh, you kids in school?

13
00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:29.249
- You having trouble focusing? - Okay, that's it!

14
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.380
Morty, find your grandfather

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.889
while I go talk to our houseguest.

16
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.060
Jerry, pay the dealer.

17
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.359
Yeah, I prefer the term "pharmacist."

18
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.390
So do they!

19
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.590
Any chance you have...

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.080
Sorry, I left my wallet in space.

21
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.569
Are you leaving to get it?

22
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:47.380
Mr. Poopybutthole, this has gone far enough.

23
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.020
We have been really cool to you

24
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.420
in your time of need.

25
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.380
I agree, Beth.

26
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.980
I'm a pieeeece of garbage. Can you boost me up

27
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.764
so I can hook my belt to the ceiling faaaaan?

28
00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:00.140
We don't have a ceiling fan.

29
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.409
Oo weee, is that why it's so hooot?

30
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.420
They're not expensivvve.

31
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.620
Bet you didn't expect to see me in a cold open, huh?

32
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.989
Looks like I've taken another turn for the worse.

33
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.830
It all started when Beth shot me.

34
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.869
- I said I was sorry! - I know...

35
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.899
It tore you up inside...

36
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.280
- Like a bullet. - It was an accident!

37
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.220
Anyway, then I got fired from my joooob,

38
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.520
my wife left me, I broke both my leeegs,

39
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.049
failed the bar exam.

40
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.980
Ooo wee, things went downhill from there.

41
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.580
So I've been crashing with the Smiths for a while.

42
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.040
Ooo wee, I'm Mr. Pooooopybutthole

43
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.933
and this is "Rick and Morty" Seeeeason 7.

44
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.540
Hey, buddy. B-brought you a coffee.

45
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.000
I can synthesize coffee.

46
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.049
You don't need to make excuses

47
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.099
- to come see me... - Yeah, I knew you'd say that,

48
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.891
so I didn't even bring a cup.

49
00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.889
- Any progress? - Yes, Morty,

50
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.599
I found the version of me that killed my wife.

51
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.629
- You just missed it. - Okay, I get it.

52
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.940
I had a big sword fight with him on top of Hoover Dam.

53
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.600
He fell and landed on a sharp spike,

54
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.630
and then whispered, "Thank you," like a werewolf.

55
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.000
I was asking to be polite.

56
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.460
The family wants you upstairs to deal with Mr. Poopybutthole.

57
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.689
It's finally time, huh?

58
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.704
Well, lucky for you guys, I know how to make someone leave.

59
00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:45.040
- Family, I present to you, Robo-Ghost. - Rick!

60
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.579
- Your plan is to scare him away? - Avoidance much?

61
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.600
I'm listening.

62
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.569
Assembling body.

63
00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.924
- _ - Activating sentience.

64
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.886
Uploading business.

65
00:02:57.887 --> 00:02:59.012
_

66
00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.150
Unfinished business detected.

67
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.480
Terminating body.

68
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.000
Okay. I need to make gravity part of its finished business

69
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.750
and leave floors unfinished.

70
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.300
- Starting over. - Dad, you can't keep putting this off.

71
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.099
- You're doing an intervention with us. - Nope.

72
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.199
Then we're sticking Poopybutthole downstairs with you.

73
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.240
What is this? I-Is this an intervention of me not intervening?

74
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.879
Y-You know this can't make the concept work,

75
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.380
not comedically or clinically.

76
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.340
Its success rate is 10% in both areas.

77
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.910
Then you have to help him on your own.

78
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.240
And not with a ghost.

79
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.660
Oo, that... that's interesting.

80
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.820
You kind of gave him a little power by mentioning him.

81
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.320
There's a lot of science to unpack about ghosts...

82
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.767
After I talk to my friend.

83
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.649
He's in the living room, Rick.

84
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.189
I'm not doing this by myself!

85
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.979
Oh, so you're going to have an intervention?

86
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.279
No. I'm going to get some friends

87
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.419
to help me talk to a friend, and you'd know the difference

88
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.060
if you weren't stupid and had friends.

89
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.389
You're mean! Dad!

90
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.940
- Pick your battles, honey. - Ha ha!

91
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.160
Yeah, fuck you, Summer.

92
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.640
- God damn it. - Your portal closed.

93
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.740
Oh, did it?

94
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.529
Have an intervention, or we'll intervention you,

95
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.820
you bunch of stupids.

96
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.960
Gearhead! Buddy! Listen.

97
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.529
We gotta help Mr. Poopybutthole.

98
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.669
He's in a bad place.

99
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.419
Well, that sounds like an intervention,

100
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.924
which Gearhead no Likehead.

101
00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.029
It's not an intervention. And you owe me.

102
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.290
Okay, fine, but now I need a drink.

103
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.800
Make it to go and make it two.

104
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.259
Rick, you son of a squanch!

105
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.060
Squanch! Told you he wasn't dead.

106
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.559
- We squanching? - A little.

107
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.220
We need to have a hang with Poopybutthole

108
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.940
- and talk to him about... - His drinking.

109
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.484
Us? Not without a squanch.

110
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.487
- I'd love one if you're pouring. - Make it three.

111
00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:42.140
You left a Gromflomite femur in the compost.

112
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.480
Your human side is passionate but careless.

113
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.240
I also found your Federation hit list...

114
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.449
Ugh! Don't go through my stuff!

115
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.910
This place is worse than prison.

116
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.620
- Rick. - BP!

117
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.020
It's been a minute.

118
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.580
- Is... someone here? - Birddaughter.

119
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.080
- You found her. - Yes.

120
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.990
She was imprisoned in a femme fatale training camp.

121
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.060
That's great! L-Let's go celebrate with our closest friends

122
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.979
by encouraging Poopybutthole to dial back his drinking!

123
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.730
Suspect. But I find fatherhood exhausting

124
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.989
and would like to show my daughter

125
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.901
what real selfishness looks like.

126
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.697
Perfect! Now, do we know anyone sober?

127
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.909
- Have you been drinking? - On a Thursday?

128
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.109
He seems ideal.

129
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.149
- Waah! - So, where to?

130
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.319
- A coffee shop? - No. He'll know something's up.

131
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.290
Yeah! And I'm not squanching just coffee!

132
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.720
Let's squanch him to a bar!

133
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.289
It would undercut our messaging.

134
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.169
- So it is an intervention. - No!

135
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.719
We're not asking anybody to stop drinking

136
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.500
because we're not hypocrites or squares,

137
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.040
we're just concerned friends.

138
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.359
Then we can at least do it at a place with a bar.

139
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.060
Look, I think if it has food, it's allowed to have a bar.

140
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.769
Appreciate you guys taking me out.

141
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.020
It's been a rough week.

142
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.689
Amy's taking pilaaaates from a guy named Guy.

143
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.920
You've been surveilling your ex-wife?

144
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.609
Oooweeee, not with the restraining order!

145
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.580
I hired a Predator to follow her around.

146
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.140
You can hire Predators?

147
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.360
Yeah, they're cheap because they live for the hunt...

148
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.640
you just have to pay 'em to not kill your target,

149
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.459
and if they stay cloaked, there's no licensing fee.

150
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.720
Welcome to Fuck You's!

151
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.329
My name is Mart, and... Fuck you!

152
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.340
See, at Fuck You's, we lightly tease our customers.

153
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.769
Oh, this is fun!

154
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.460
What do you know, Gilligan?

155
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.634
Nice!

156
00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.680
Look at this depressed pencil eraser.

157
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.520
Did some middle schooler stick you up a cat's asshole?

158
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.800
I bet you had everything

159
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.410
and you watched it slip through your powerless little fingers

160
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.059
like the sands of time.

161
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.459
Be right back to take your order, folks,

162
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.609
or should I say, fucks!

163
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.240
Perhaps this wasn't the best place to do this, Rick.

164
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.863
What are you talkin' about?

165
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.824
This is a great place to celebrate my birthdaaay!

166
00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.994
Birthday... Birthday...

167
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.409
Birthday... Birthday...

168
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.000
- Birthday... Birthday... - Your birthday?

169
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.040
Ooo weee. I can't believe y'all remembered!

170
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.740
I was at the end of my rope,

171
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.620
thinking I'd worn out aaall my welcomeees.

172
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.883
Thanks for doing all this, Riiick!

173
00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.520
O-of course, Mr. PB. What are friends for?

174
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.240
Heard we got a birthday boy?!

175
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.940
Yeeeah, but please don't sing or...

176
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.959
Yah! Fuck you, shithead!

177
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.419
_

178
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.630
Haha, yeah. That sure is a smart hat...

179
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.989
Because even my son Poopy Jr. hates me!

180
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.025
Ooooweehehehe!

181
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.209
I can relate.

182
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.430
Birddaughter is a total bitch.

183
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.114
If you're a parent, you can say that.

184
00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:31.849
Weeeell. Should we do shooots?

185
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.900
Rick?

186
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.660
Let's get riggity-riggity-wrecked!

187
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.770
âª I-I-I take a shot âª

188
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.690
âª Do a pop, blow a line, huff turpentine âª

189
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.339
âª Get wrecked, text your ex, fight a cop, feeling fine âª

190
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.519
âª Punch your dick, turn some tricks âª

191
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.629
âª Quit your job, buy a dog âª

192
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.000
âª Have two beers, then ten more âª

193
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.540
âª Pop a pill and meet the floor âª

194
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.000
That one's not my bellybutton.

195
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.509
Well, what is it?

196
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.107
Oo weee!

197
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.800
Whoa!

198
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:05.819
Whoo-hoo!

199
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.140
Hold on, everyone!

200
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.900
- Whoa! - Ah!

201
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.239
- Oh, God! - Oh, woah!

202
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.908
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

203
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.249
Is there a restroom?!

204
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.260
At the front.

205
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:19.640
Oh, it was a bad idea! Oooo weee!

206
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.790
- Yeah, ha ha! - Oh, man!

207
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:24.545
Oooo weee!

208
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.133
- Whoo! - Aah!

209
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.260
Oh, shit, it's happening!

210
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.388
Honey rave!

211
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.339
Bee time, baby!

212
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.549
Whoa, what world is this?

213
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.520
- We're on Earth. - How do you know?

214
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.640
Because I think that is Hugh Jackman.

215
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.691
Oh, shit, it is.

216
00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.269
Hey, Jackman!

217
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.939
Makes sense he recognizes me. We both hosted the Oscars.

218
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.290
It's a pretty exclusive club.

219
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.909
Listen, guys, don't make this tacky.

220
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.035
Nobody call him "Wolverine." Just treat him like a regular...

221
00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:56.900
Gene! Small world, mate!

222
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.049
Hugh! Hugh married my cousin.

223
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.249
Which I guess makes him a Wolver-ine-law.

224
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.835
Ha ha! That is fantastic!

225
00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.379
Hey, didn't you host the Oscars?

226
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.631
- Yeah, I, uh... - All right, all right, listen.

227
00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:10.490
Now, I'm not assuming you guys want to party

228
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.769
with me tonight, but if you do...

229
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:12.789
- Ooo wee! - I wanna party with Hugh Jackman.

230
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.380
- Squanch yeah! - If you do,

231
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.940
you do it together, as a team.

232
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.660
Now, I need to go take what I call a "Huge Ackman."

233
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.460
Ackman is Australian slang for shit.

234
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.410
Don't look it up. Do make a decision.

235
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.379
Because from here, I'm heading to the Jack Shack.

236
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.009
- What's the Jack Shack? - It's just his house.

237
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.112
But, guys, I don't think we should go there.

238
00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:32.940
I challenge you to explain why not

239
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.866
without making us want to go more.

240
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.489
Well, Hugh's pretty anti-limitation.

241
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.621
When he parties, it gets extreme.

242
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:41.744
Challenge failed.

243
00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:43.620
Woah! What's extreme by the Gene metric?

244
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.333
Does he have "Les Mis" shot glasses?

245
00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:47.337
We're not exactly squanchweights, brother.

246
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.820
It's my birthday, and I wish to party with Huuugh Jackman.

247
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.591
âª Then you shaaaaaalllllllll! âª

248
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.511
- That was a fast shit. - But first everybody's taking these.

249
00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:56.520
What are they?

250
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.939
Huh, maybe they're Tic Tacs. Maybe they're cyanide.

251
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.739
Maybe I don't like to party

252
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.769
with people that hesitate.

253
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.720
Heh heh heh! There you go!

254
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.980
That's the spirit!

255
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.481
Now we're all completely...

256
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:10.276
âª Fuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh! âª

257
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.059
This was not oversold!

258
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.580
"A, B, D, E"... I lost my "C."

259
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.286
My alphabet has no "C"!

260
00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:21.420
Did I do these already?

261
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.831
D-Did I ask that already?

262
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.500
Squanch, yeah! My turn!

263
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.377
Did I win?

264
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.756
- Mm. Mm. - Ahhh...

265
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.000
The best bloody day of my life.

266
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.180
My wedding was pretty great, too.

267
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.080
I was talking about the Tony award.

268
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.555
Yooohoho! Pull!

269
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.300
- Yeah! - Woo-hoo!

270
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.765
We're squanching now!

271
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.049
Why the long face, mate?

272
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.620
Shape of my skull.

273
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.910
You know, Mr. Poopybutthole,

274
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.529
when I wrote "Caribbean Queen," you know what my agent said?

275
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.630
- Billy Ocean wrote that... - That's what he said.

276
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.329
Exactly that. "Billy Ocean wrote this.

277
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.029
Don't write it again. You're not Billy Ocean."

278
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.988
You know what I did? I fired my agent.

279
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:59.569
Don't accept other people's limitations.

280
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.700
What does your heart want, lil' ripper?

281
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.139
Right now, don't think.

282
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.369
Right now, my heart wants Amy back.

283
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.586
Everybody! Our friend wants Amy back.

284
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.544
- Squanch idea! - I will agree to anything in this state.

285
00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:14.720
I do not think that's a good idea.

286
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.600
Ladies and gentlemen! This man is a fake friend!

287
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.782
- Come on, Hugh. - "Come on, Hugh.

288
00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:20.940
Come on, everybody.

289
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.500
Don't call Hugh Jackman Wolverine.

290
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.989
Don't call yourself Billy Ocean.

291
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.329
Don't get Amy Back."

292
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.299
You're a vampire, brother.

293
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.062
You feed off other people's energy.

294
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:31.380
- That is kind of true. - Are you kidding me?!

295
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.440
You've been living on my daughter's sofa for months!

296
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.060
- Do you want me to leave? - The entire family does!

297
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.572
- Why not say something? - Because you're my friend!

298
00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:42.009
A real friend would have known it's not my birthday.

299
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.240
Oooooooooh, shit!

300
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.330
Fake friend!

301
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.040
You're not helping, Hugh Jackman!

302
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.189
Yoooooou do not tell meeeeee what to do!

303
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.309
- Or anyone here. - Affirmative.

304
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.320
- Woo! - Yeah, baby!

305
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.340
Why would you pretend it was your birthday?!

306
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.589
You think I don't know a half-assed intervention

307
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.900
when I see one coming?!

308
00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.552
Oooooooooooooh, shit!

309
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.429
Mm! I love where you are, man.

310
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.729
You're just Wolverining right now. You... You feel that?

311
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.869
I think so.

312
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.642
Does Wolverining hurt a little?

313
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:07.869
Every time!

314
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.561
All right, grab a drink to go, gentlemen.

315
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.569
Because we're either getting Amy back...

316
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.190
or... we're going home.

317
00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:15.500
- You're nuts! - Then nut me up, bitch!

318
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.309
Nut me up!

319
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.530
Nut me up! Nut me up!

320
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.840
- It's not an expression! - Woo!

321
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.618
- Ha ha! - Amy's coming back dead or alive!

322
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.630
- Woah! - Haha!

323
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.900
- Yes! - Yeah!

324
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.049
Fake friend, my ass.

325
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.689
I know how to be there for my friends.

326
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.579
Father?! Why?!

327
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.590
Ah, crap. Hang on.

328
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.329
Lemme go upstairs and grab the business finisher.

329
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.760
From where I'm sitting,

330
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.340
you're the one with unfinished business.

331
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.095
Hey, mind your own business.

332
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.880
Business is my business!

333
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.516
And, brother, business is good.

334
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.240
Oh, you come back to ruin our fuuun?

335
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.140
No. To help you finish this.

336
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160
I made you guys come out

337
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.340
because I didn't want to talk to PB alone.

338
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.032
I'm here to go down with the ship.

339
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.920
- Respect, Rick. - Hit it, Hugh!

340
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.959
_

341
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.204
âª I lose my cool when she steps in the room âª

342
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.583
âª Unh, unh âª

343
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:16.754
âª And I get so excited just from her perfume âª

344
00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:19.673
Oo weee, there she is. My Amy!

345
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.880
âª Electric eyes âª

346
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.849
- âª That you can't ignore âª - Oh, she feels my love around her!

347
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.599
- Oowee! - Wow. Your love is pretty strong.

348
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.509
- I guess that's not all she's feeling. - âª And passion burns you âª

349
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.039
- âª Like never before âª - Predator P.I.?

350
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.773
This is the opposite of what I hired you for!

351
00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:39.729
Now, now. Did you do this, Gul'Karna?

352
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.499
- âª I was in search of a good time âª - You do this?

353
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.080
- You do this? - âª Just running my game âª

354
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.745
- I'm gonna uncloak this later... - Now. Now. Now.

355
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.920
Okay, honestly, PB, that could have gone a lot worse...

356
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.957
PB?

357
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.410
- âª Caribbean Queen âª - Ooooweeee, gotta goooo!

358
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.990
Run!

359
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.880
I'm too drunk to flee a Predator right now!

360
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.677
Mud! The... The mud thing! Everyone mud up and hide!

361
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.960
What's that smell?

362
00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.820
Ugh, Squanchy! That's not mud.

363
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.224
Well, I'm not from this planet!

364
00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.879
Daddy, what's happening?

365
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.909
Quiet, Poopy Jr.! I'm taking you home!

366
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.080
Aah!

367
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.180
Look, I just didn't think I could...

368
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.040
- What? Be honest? - Don't high-road me!

369
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.590
It's just as dishonest to play dumb

370
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.945
about wearing out your welcome!

371
00:14:21.946 --> 00:14:24.155
- You could've just told me! - You're an adult!

372
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.620
Read the room and figure it out!

373
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.804
I admit it... that... that was self destructive.

374
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.080
Use me as a shield!

375
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.420
- I feel nothing! - Ca-cawwww!

376
00:14:55.438 --> 00:14:57.140
Squanch this!

377
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.560
I'm so...

378
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.500
I'm so squanched up, man.

379
00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.074
I-I'm not really with these guys.

380
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.970
I was just walking in this park...

381
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.080
Aagh!

382
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.740
No!

383
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.580
Why is this my thing?!

384
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.180
No! I won't let you take my family from me!

385
00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:26.240
Ow! Oh, ohhhhhhh!

386
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.930
Guess you didn't see season 4, episode 3!

387
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:35.101
Let's go... Oh! Oh! Ohh! Fuck!

388
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.270
Oh!

389
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.380
Who's got the three dots on their forehead now?

390
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.483
Could have done that before he punched me.

391
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.904
Suck my squanch!

392
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.469
Ahhh!

393
00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.390
Gimme that big ol' tooth!

394
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.209
Gullll'Karrrna...

395
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.089
No, no, no, stop!

396
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.000
What are you doing? I want that skull!

397
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.619
No, Rick. No more.

398
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.519
This is my fault. All of it.

399
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.260
And if he's gonna protect my wife and chiiild,

400
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.229
that's a great thing to know while I get my shit together.

401
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.349
Wayne?

402
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.891
- Wayne? - Aaaamy.

403
00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.459
I-I messed up real baaad.

404
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.180
I came to say I don't know what to do without you,

405
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.310
but I guess I can start by not kidnapping.

406
00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.153
That's definitely where you should start.

407
00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:33.283
I'm... sorry, Amy.

408
00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.449
You should be. But I'm not.

409
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.121
We're a family now...

410
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.100
Me, Poopy Jr., and Gul'Karna,

411
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.319
Clan Leader of The Skin-Thieves.

412
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.130
Goodbye, Wayne.

413
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.171
Goodbye.

414
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.549
Ooo-weee, a musket?

415
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.677
I'm starting to think it's like their currency.

416
00:16:50.678 --> 00:16:52.880
I hunt because I must.

417
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.431
But man possesses a precious gift... the power to change.

418
00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.469
More like the power of music, bitch!

419
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.960
- What the fuck?! - Jesus, Hugh,

420
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.400
we were just resolving it.

421
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.550
Well, I'm an actor, and I'm high.

422
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.575
"'Caribbean Queen,'

423
00:17:05.576 --> 00:17:07.693
written by Hugh Jackman, age sixteen."

424
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.679
How's that for a twist?

425
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.779
Confusing.

426
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.781
Well, sometimes you have to believe.

427
00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.840
Wow, that's reeeal inspiring.

428
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:15.949
Makes me think of how...

429
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.949
- Get the hell out of here! - Okay, okay, sorry!

430
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.940
All right, guys, I'm buying drive-through tacos,

431
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.370
but nobody tells my nutritionist and we have to steal a car.

432
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.870
"Wayne," huh?

433
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.190
Oooweee.

434
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.870
But I prefer Mr. Pooooopybutthole.

435
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.269
More refined.

436
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.830
It appears Birddaughter has broken into another Federation compound.

437
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.849
I must go.

438
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.127
Wayne, this counts as attending your actual birthday.

439
00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:44.856
Rick. It was... canonical to see you.

440
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.119
Yeah, let's call it.

441
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.719
I wanna pass out before I remember what we did tonight.

442
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.700
I never want to forget it.

443
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.880
And I never want to repeat it.

444
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.260
Proud of you, little buddy.

445
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.742
You too, Squanch.

446
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.799
Awww, fuck! Look at us!

447
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.100
A bird guy, talking cat, uh, what are you?

448
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.900
A robot man, and a mutant.

449
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.039
Wow. Was a bonzer night, mates!

450
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.540
That's one for the books.

451
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.210
Oooo, bonzer night indeed.

452
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.360
Kept in touch with the guys over the years.

453
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.169
As much as ya can in this fast world.

454
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.770
Birdperson went home to take on a challenge

455
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.849
way more difficult than a Predator...

456
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.900
raising Birddaughter.

457
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.149
Gearhead went back to The Gear System

458
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.189
and got a spinal replacement.

459
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.059
He's still paying it off.

460
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.300
Squanchy?

461
00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.780
Checked himself into a nice rehab.

462
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.429
No one thought it would stick, and it didn't.

463
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.033
He was later arrested for smuggling toad venom across the border.

464
00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.170
Hugh Jackman went to the Jack Shack

465
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.240
to glue back together the Tony award that Gene shot.

466
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.920
And possibly to put a bullet

467
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.240
in all future Wolverine references.

468
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.499
Thanks to us.

469
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.709
And what came of Rick?

470
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.172
I think he learned something that night.

471
00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.280
About friendship.

472
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.700
About honesty.

473
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.360
And maybe he learned something about himseelllf.

474
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.420
Oh. Here. Forgot to give you a fading pill.

475
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.989
Great for hangovers. Just to clarify,

476
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.740
I-I had to take an un-fading pill

477
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.259
to counteract the original fading pill I just took.

478
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.149
Oh. Uh. Okay?

479
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.220
And if you're hung up on why the taxi disappeared,

480
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.629
the... the pills aren't sentient,

481
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.149
but they do detect human coverings,

482
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.989
so it saw the taxi as some sort of large overcoat...

483
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.480
doesn't matter.

484
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.509
You, uh, gonna be all right?

485
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.200
Got a place to stay?

486
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.240
I can 3D print you an apartment on the moon.

487
00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.579
I'll figure it out, Rick. Thanks.

488
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.000
Well, here I go pill'in again.

489
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:36.589
Yep. Don't any of you worry about Mr. Pooooopybutthole.

490
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.269
I got a lot of work to do,

491
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.229
but I'll land on my poopy little feet.

492
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.320
I always do!

493
00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.680
Owww! This burns like hell!

494
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.440
How did the other guys not react?

495
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.730
Is mine different?

496
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.120
It's like my skin is boiling!

497
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.149
Guys, I got the Best Buds Burrito Box!

498
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.880
They normally ask for proof of friendship,

499
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.270
but the cashier trusted me that you guys were out...

500
00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.740
... heeere.

501
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.580
Not cool, man.

502
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.159
Aah.

503
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.519
You don't have to do this, Sheriff!

504
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.160
It's your last day on the job!

505
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.289
That's exactly why I must.

506
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.289
I ain't retiring a coward.

507
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.390
Now get out of here, Officer.

508
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.680
And go take care of my granddaughter.

509
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.220
âª When I was young and in my prime âª

510
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.579
âª My mind being free from care âª

511
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.860
I ain't scared of you!

512
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.609
âª Whilst leaving all in Donegal âª

513
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.040
âª That I might plough âª

514
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.820
âª The raging main âª

515
00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.179
âª Going to Amerikay... âª

516
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.860
W-What happened?

517
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.249
I think it ran out of gas.

518
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.349
Oh.

519
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.680
Sooo, he could have survived

520
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.909
if he just stood back five feet?

521
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.310
Well...

522
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.166
let's not tell his granddaughter that.
