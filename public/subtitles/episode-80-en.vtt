1
00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:06.756
I gotta ask, is someone requesting pancakes?

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.342
'Cause it feels like we eat them all the time.

3
00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.806
It just says "The Hospital."

4
00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.266
Bold caller ID.

5
00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.101
Hello? Oh.

6
00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.644
Hey, Junior.

7
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.148
Aw, jeez. Okay, yeah.

8
00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.441
Bye.

9
00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.692
That was my son.

10
00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:28.611
Morty Jr.,

11
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.739
with the hands coming out of his head.

12
00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.533
Oh, fuck that guy!

13
00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.201
-Boo. -Guys, come on.

14
00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.662
Morty, he wrote a New York Times bestseller

15
00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.372
about what a bad dad you are.

16
00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.666
It made us look bad for raising you.

17
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.836
From one writer to another, the guy is a hack piece of shit!

18
00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.963
It's okay to hate your kids, Morty.

19
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.965
But he called from the hospital.

20
00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.884
You think he's dying?

21
00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.177
Who cares?

22
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.722
Well, it's not me.

23
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.893
-Oh, shit! Our table's ready. -OMG!

24
00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.436
Summer made me get a reservation

25
00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.480
for us at some dumb pre-cog restaurant.

26
00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.981
It's the toast of Food-Tok.

27
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.816
They predetermine what you'd wanna eat

28
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.193
before you even get there.

29
00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.237
Time to see if this place is worth having to go to it.

30
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.446
It'll beat this shit.

31
00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.573
Opa!

32
00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.534
And hey, Morty, sorry about your terrible son.

33
00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:18.787
I say let him die alone in that hospital bed.

34
00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.748
Damn. Rule of threes, huh?

35
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.084
Oh, my vibrator!

36
00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.418
Sorry, honey.

37
00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:26.753
Our vibrator.

38
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.590
What? Do you want me to pull it out and show it to you?

39
00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:32.175
-We're good. -Let's get the hell out of here.

40
00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.510
Jesus Christ.

41
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.379
Welcome back to Downbeat The Game The Show.

42
00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.548
Contestants, you know the rules.

43
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.633
Father, you came.

44
00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.093
Junior, wow.

45
00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.053
You got old fast.

46
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.681
Well, time flies when you're a Gazorpian.

47
00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.269
I suppose you read the book.

48
00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:27.063
It was hard to avoid for a while.

49
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.482
Yeah. You said some tough stuff

50
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.025
to a pretty wide audience.

51
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.528
-I'm... sorry. -Hey.

52
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:36.239
That's family... I guess.

53
00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:40.118
Can't help but notice you're... dying.

54
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.163
I didn't ask you here to talk about that.

55
00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.832
I was hoping you would help me make peace

56
00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.333
with my mother.

57
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:51.504
Oh, yeah. That might be tough.

58
00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.175
The thing is, your mother was...

59
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.885
A semen receptacle?

60
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.012
Oh, you...

61
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.722
You heard, huh?

62
00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.932
I know she was made to process seed

63
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.226
and never technically alive, but...

64
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.353
I'd still like to pay my respects.

65
00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:11.566
Well, see, I'm not proud of where she ended up.

66
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.235
You think I'm proud of any of my life choices?

67
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.197
Yeah, I did hear about the...

68
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.324
the soft canceling.

69
00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:22.035
-Oh. -I didn't take any joy from it.

70
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.121
You know what? Let's see what we can do.

71
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.210
I love when restaurants have a big tank.

72
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.962
I don't know. This aesthetic really clashes with the table buzzer.

73
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.964
Smith, party of two.

74
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.800
Oh my God! So worth it!

75
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.177
Perfectly predicted.

76
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.888
Oh, I did want this, but I never saw it coming!

77
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.558
Oh, snap. The wooden balls.

78
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.477
You think the cogs are behind there?

79
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.229
Who cares? This place is all gimmick.

80
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.314
Are you grumpy about everything?

81
00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.650
They bring you food and you eat it.

82
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.902
Ooh, that's totally us!

83
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.362
What do you think I ordered? Ribs?

84
00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.739
No, boring. Space ribs.

85
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.867
Oh, nice.

86
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.369
Morlackian fawn.

87
00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.663
Aside its mother's tentacle.

88
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.083
Pretty good.

89
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.543
See? Lay it on me!

90
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:15.922
Avocado toast?

91
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.132
With cracked pepper on top.

92
00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.842
Okay.

93
00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.970
I mean, pepper's pretty normal.

94
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.847
So are you. You brought us to a restaurant from the internet.

95
00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.440
Okay, yes. I guess I deserve this.

96
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.442
You're not pranking me?

97
00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.404
No, no. This is where Gwendolyn was laid to rest.

98
00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.489
Is this your trash bin?

99
00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:45.201
Rick's garbage portal.

100
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.661
Doesn't sound any better.

101
00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:48.746
Look, I told you I wasn't proud of this.

102
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.914
Alright then.

103
00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:56.379
"Mother, I'm told your mouth was always open, but...

104
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.923
I'm sure your heart was as well."

105
00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.217
Eh, who am I kidding? This sucks.

106
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.679
Wait. I see you're making a move to go in.

107
00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.432
I will... go in first. Okay?

108
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.061
How much stuff does your grandfather throw away?

109
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.771
A lot. He likes to get drunk

110
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.690
and invent stuff that doesn't make any sense.

111
00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:17.108
Pretty wasteful.

112
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:19.485
Yeah. That's why Rick built Salva-tron,

113
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.696
a self-replicating system that filters the trash

114
00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.156
for anything valuable.

115
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.700
They're coming over. Just a formality.

116
00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.453
Value detected. Value detected.

117
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.623
Hesitancy detected?

118
00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:33.833
Yeah. What's up?

119
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.669
It's just if I find anything of value,

120
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.713
I have to tell Rick about it.

121
00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:40.006
Okay.

122
00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.051
And, you know, talking to Rick can be dicey.

123
00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.553
I mean, the last Salva-tron found a bag of diamonds

124
00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:48.306
and Rick yelled at them about how diamonds are bullshit.

125
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.100
Right, but I'm his grandson.

126
00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.603
How do I know he didn't throw his grandson away?

127
00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.938
Sorry, pal, but I can't risk it.

128
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.608
Good news is you will look like trash when I'm done.

129
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.526
Run!

130
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.403
How was that good news?

131
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.616
Even the plate tastes good.

132
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.117
What's the story with dessert?

133
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:11.245
Can I just ask for lava cake, or do I have to think it at them?

134
00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.831
Alright. I'll try it.

135
00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:15.583
Maybe I'm missing something.

136
00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.005
No! It's just fucking avocado toast!

137
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.840
And the avocado's not even that ripe.

138
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.760
Summer...

139
00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:28.137
This place runs on future predicty pre-cog bullshit.

140
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.701
You don't wanna get caught up in that.

141
00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.850
I'm gonna say something.

142
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.853
No! Summer! You're not Morty. I can't just grab you.

143
00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:38.606
Which one of you assholes...

144
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:39.690
...did this to me?

145
00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:40.942
Hey, no finishing my sentences.

146
00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:42.318
You're wrong about me.

147
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.070
I want hype, sophisticated space food

148
00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:45.864
with an element of cruelty in its preparation.

149
00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:46.989
Come on, Sum-Sum.

150
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.867
They're clearly luring us into some complicated,

151
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.786
12-steps-ahead examination of determinism and causality.

152
00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.288
Anything you do here pulls us further into their bullshit.

153
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.832
-I'm... -...more complex than that!

154
00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.435
-I said stop that! -I said stop that!

155
00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:59.085
You guys think you know everything.

156
00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.421
With your big heads and slimming bodysuits.

157
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.298
But maybe you won't see this!

158
00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.300
Ow! Fuck!

159
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.553
Jesus, Summer! You hit it with a pan?

160
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.514
I thought it would see it coming. I even teed it up a little.

161
00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.724
Summer Smith, come out with your hands up!

162
00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:14.809
You are under arrest!

163
00:07:14.892 --> 00:07:16.227
How'd the cops get here so fast?

164
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.646
-They obviously... -...called in a tip ahead of time.

165
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.483
You like that? You like us saying the same thing at the same time?

166
00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.110
'Cause that could be the whole story, Summer.

167
00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:25.445
Except it won't because...

168
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.071
...the cops are surrounding us!

169
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.073
Shut up! We're stuck in this now.

170
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.409
The only reason I haven't burned this place to the ground is because

171
00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:32.994
the cogs probably want that!

172
00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:35.746
Rick Sanchez will realize the cogs are a better hang.

173
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.540
What? That'd only be true if...

174
00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.333
The cogs only want what he wants.

175
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.211
Okay. What do I want?

176
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.005
Dessert! It is already ordered.

177
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.673
To a cool safehouse.

178
00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:46.757
I'm listening.

179
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.843
You're flipping sides over dessert?

180
00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:49.927
Hey, I liked my meal.

181
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.971
But this is exactly what you said they'd do to me.

182
00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:53.723
Yeah, and you got us into this mess.

183
00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.767
New plan, Summer. We're taking these cogs to go!

184
00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.606
Come back! Maybe I just need to scan you again.

185
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.153
Guys? Hello?

186
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.489
I see a bunch of rubble.

187
00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.866
Is it safe to say I killed you?

188
00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.828
Salva-tron, you've done it again!

189
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.582
Junior!

190
00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.417
Oh, God! Are you okay?

191
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.586
I hope I didn't speed up your death.

192
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:26.255
I'm alright... I think.

193
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.508
Is that a walking pizza box?

194
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.510
It's not safe here. Come quickly!

195
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.304
We call it Garbtopia because it's made of garbage.

196
00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:34.388
Yeah, I got it.

197
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.849
So Salva-tron's just been attacking everything?

198
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.936
If it's all garbage, there's no need to tell Rick.

199
00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.730
Look at all these eclectic survivors.

200
00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:46.108
Yeah, there was a while where Rick's inventions could all walk and talk.

201
00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.611
Hey, big boy. Wanna drain that python?

202
00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.655
Eh, it was a short period.

203
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:52.532
Hey, we're looking for someone.

204
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.699
Can you help us?

205
00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:56.244
I think I saw her in the graveyard!

206
00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.455
Down that tunnel over there!

207
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.916
Oh, and the pizza points the way.

208
00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:04.919
Wish you hadn't shit it on the ground. I'm kinda hungry.

209
00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:06.170
Junior?

210
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.630
Gobliniduss!

211
00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.632
Claim your magic power!

212
00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.843
-But how do I find it? -But how do I find it?

213
00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.762
Brave little goblin, all alone

214
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.848
No parents here to raise you

215
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.601
Go, little goblin, leave that home

216
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.437
Your magic will amaze you

217
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.815
It's the Enchanted Goblin series.

218
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.775
Yeah, it's like our bible down here.

219
00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:29.986
I wrote Enchanted Goblin.

220
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.487
All seven books!

221
00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:35.950
I guess you really enjoyed that box set I sent you.

222
00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:37.577
We have a complicated relationship!

223
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.288
No, no, my first book wouldn't exactly have left you

224
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:41.831
aching for more.

225
00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.708
That's all in the past, son.

226
00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:46.002
I'm glad we're on this adventure together.

227
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:49.255
Now, what do you say we go see your dead mom?!

228
00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:53.593
Summer Smith, two o'clock.

229
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.720
She complains about you having a good time.

230
00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:58.181
Don't get in the water. I need a dry person to hand me things.

231
00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.557
We've been here for hours.

232
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.601
By design. It's called holing up.

233
00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:04.729
Relax. Have some of the giant Ã©clair they knew would delight me.

234
00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:06.897
It really is so fun that it's big.

235
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.774
Summer Smith will not relax.

236
00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.444
Yeah, because Rick's hanging with you guys instead of me.

237
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.988
Summer, you threw a pan at them and they took us to a pool.

238
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:16.324
The cogs are great. Check this out.

239
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.246
See this? We didn't rehearse it at all.

240
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.874
So much for being "trapped" in its cog bullshit.

241
00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:26.917
Weren't you all worried about its endgame?

242
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:29.003
Summer, this is its endgame. It loves me.

243
00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:31.214
And if it wanted to be free, it could leave at any time it wants.

244
00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.715
Open door policy.

245
00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:33.799
-Gasp! -Oh, come on,

246
00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.468
like you didn't know I'd do that?

247
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:36.802
Why are you sulking?

248
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.596
You wanted to be at a restaurant with cogs.

249
00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.389
This is nominally different at best.

250
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.600
I wanted to be at a restaurant with you!

251
00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:44.894
I just wanted you to try some cool shit with me.

252
00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.855
Summer! You wanted me on this dumb hang because, deep down,

253
00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:49.398
you think you know what I want.

254
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.360
This thing actually knows before I even want it.

255
00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:55.029
Wow! The Ã©clair's good wet, too.

256
00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:57.657
Rick does Jell-O shots! Rick does Jell-O shots!

257
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.200
These cogs know what's up!

258
00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.702
Jell-O shot delivery.

259
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.120
Can you grab 'em, Summer?

260
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.290
This is why it's good to have someone out of the pool.

261
00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.375
-I... -...hate these cog assholes!

262
00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.794
I love you guys.

263
00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:11.504
Shots! Shots! Shots!

264
00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.506
My God.

265
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:14.632
Yeah.

266
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:18.678
I guess one man's trash is another man's beautiful...

267
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:19.845
cemetery?

268
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.515
Looks like there's a sex robot section over that way.

269
00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:27.561
There she is.

270
00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:31.399
Hello, Mother.

271
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.442
It's me, your baby boy.

272
00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.611
I wish I could've known you.

273
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.531
She was... the finest I ever had.

274
00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:39.782
Well, top three.

275
00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:42.493
-Top five at least. -Oh, top five, eh?

276
00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:44.495
There's a lot more than five too!

277
00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:46.122
It's high praise.

278
00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.748
Your mom could really throw it back.

279
00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:51.168
Oh, I know a thing or two about ranking whom I've slept with.

280
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:53.003
Oh, yeah?

281
00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:56.298
Two words: Heather Locklear.

282
00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:57.675
That's my boy!

283
00:11:57.758 --> 00:11:59.301
Thank you for bringing me here...

284
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.386
Dad.

285
00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:02.096
You're welcome, son.

286
00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:03.472
I'm happy we did this.

287
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.851
So are we!

288
00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:08.352
God! Who are you?

289
00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:09.437
Let us go!

290
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.605
I am that which should not be!

291
00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.400
I am the trash of the trash!

292
00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:16.569
They don't let me live with everyone else.

293
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.697
Human boy, Rick spawn,

294
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.950
I know you can open the door to the up-above!

295
00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.535
Salva-tron will kill us up there!

296
00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:26.579
I'll take my chances.

297
00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:28.122
I'm sorry, Junior.

298
00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:30.082
I was a horrible father!

299
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:32.626
I didn't understand the consequences of anything!

300
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.879
And now this thing's gonna kill us

301
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:36.380
when you were already dying.

302
00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.965
I'm the fucking worst!

303
00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.843
-Well, I'm not actually dying. -What?

304
00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.220
You just sort of inferred, projected, really.

305
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.389
I never said out loud I was dying.

306
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:47.725
-What?! -I needed material for my new book!

307
00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.477
A sequel to My Horrible Father.

308
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.936
It's my only book that made money!

309
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.439
Let me punch him! Let me punch my asshole son!

310
00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:54.982
You're both assholes!

311
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:58.235
That conversation you just had about ranking women was gross.

312
00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.945
It was trash planet talk!

313
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:01.363
So is this!

314
00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:05.159
No! Junior! Junior!

315
00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:08.329
Just another day in Garbtopia.

316
00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:09.497
Let's ride!

317
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.790
No!

318
00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.583
You suck!

319
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:15.544
My kid sucked too, but I didn't want him to die.

320
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.631
Shut up! Open it with your meat paddle!

321
00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:19.840
No!

322
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:24.261
Looks like we got a Scenario 3 here, Morty.

323
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.305
You're clearly leading some kind of trash rebellion.

324
00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:27.682
Or something is wearing your skin.

325
00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:28.766
I don't know.

326
00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:30.601
I only recorded three scenarios, and the other two

327
00:13:30.684 --> 00:13:32.394
are about you doing a "Goonies."

328
00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:35.064
Anyway, talk to Salva-tron. They'll sort this out.

329
00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.900
No! Not Salva-tron!

330
00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.652
Rick! It's not a Scenario 3!

331
00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:42.530
No! Make that ladder come down!

332
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.615
I'm trying! I don't wanna be here either!

333
00:13:44.698 --> 00:13:47.034
Aw, man! You're still alive?

334
00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:48.953
And what's this fucking thing?!

335
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:50.663
This is not good for me.

336
00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:53.249
No! I have to get back

337
00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:55.709
to my wife!

338
00:13:58.462 --> 00:13:59.463
Ah, shit!

339
00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:01.549
Crawl out farther so I can shoot you!

340
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:03.092
Why would I do that?

341
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:05.719
Fine. I'll do it myself.

342
00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:08.097
Seriously?

343
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.182
This trash is not sturdy!

344
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.810
Alright, I'm actually gonna go check this time.

345
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.105
There's tunnels down here?!

346
00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.690
Aw, jeez!

347
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.276
Yoo-hoo!

348
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.698
Talk about "value detected."

349
00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.037
She had more value than you could ever know.

350
00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.789
Junior! You're alive?!

351
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.041
Courtesy of my loyal fans here.

352
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.836
These autograph hounds found me dying in the cemetery,

353
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.462
patched me up, and tunneled us to you.

354
00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.715
You really found your audience, huh?

355
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.217
I'm sorry for trying to sell you out again.

356
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:47.636
The only thing that ever made me valuable was...

357
00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:49.388
trashing you.

358
00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:52.850
I'm so broke, Dad.

359
00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:55.019
There's so many paternity lawsuits,

360
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:57.730
and let's just say The New Yorker has been sniffing around...

361
00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.815
Listen, Salva-tron knows about the tunnels.

362
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.233
We got to warn everyone!

363
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.986
Also, can you sign this now?

364
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:06.947
What the...?

365
00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:08.157
Hello?

366
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.201
Summer, I think the cogs drugged me and bailed.

367
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.037
Summer?

368
00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:15.664
Summer!

369
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.501
Summer Smith drugs the cogs!

370
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.420
Summer Smith drugs the cogs!

371
00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:22.671
Picked up on that, huh?

372
00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.632
Like you didn't know this was coming?

373
00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.052
Summer Smith gets us killed!

374
00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:31.138
That's right! Or the cogs tell the truth.

375
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:33.265
-Is avocado toast what I wanted? -What?!

376
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.393
Is avocado toast what I wanted?

377
00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:38.270
Okay, okay, it wasn't.

378
00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.731
-And I'm a good hang. -You are!

379
00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:43.233
You were right! We used you to get to your grandpa

380
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:44.610
-to get to you! -Damn right!

381
00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:47.154
I knew I wasn't a basic avocado-ass bitch.

382
00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:48.989
So let's just get to where you want to get

383
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:51.075
so I can be free of this story.

384
00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:52.242
We're down.

385
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:53.327
Oh shit!

386
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.787
Give me back my cogs!

387
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.665
Sorry, Grandpa! You said not to get caught up in cog bullshit,

388
00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.625
so I'm doing the opposite of that!

389
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:01.043
This isn't the opposite of that!

390
00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.629
Summer Smith makes a hard right in two seconds.

391
00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:05.005
But that's a billboard.

392
00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.591
-She makes a hard right. -I'm trusting you guys.

393
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.470
Holy shit, you guys are amazing.

394
00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:13.597
You don't deserve my bald little beauties!

395
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:15.307
She does a barrel roll!

396
00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:21.105
You're ruining this, Summer!

397
00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:24.608
All that future predicty cog nonsense was finally working for me.

398
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.987
I thought you wanted to hang out today.

399
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.446
Not like this!

400
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:32.992
She pulls the parking brake.

401
00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:40.165
-Oh shit! -Left! Right! Right! Left!

402
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.167
She runs her grandpa off the freeway!

403
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.756
Trash people, my people,

404
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.842
Salva-tron knows of Garbtopia.

405
00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.887
Our only chance is to take this battle to them!

406
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:57.891
If I may, it would be suicide to take a run at Salva-tron's tower.

407
00:16:57.975 --> 00:16:59.018
I agree.

408
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:01.729
Don't listen to him! That's just Devil's Advocate Bot.

409
00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:02.980
I'm glad Rick trashed him!

410
00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:04.440
If I may,

411
00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:06.316
you don't look glad.

412
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:12.281
Damn. What a noise.

413
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:17.995
The Horn of Gobliniduss is a reminder that anything is possible.

414
00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:20.748
It was blown before they toppled Gobnobb the Elf Son in book two.

415
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:22.833
And Bluegalshmoo in book three!

416
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.835
Also the White Wizard in book four!

417
00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:27.546
Alright, I get it. I went to the same well a lot.

418
00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:29.423
You read Enchanted Goblin?

419
00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:30.841
Yeah, I loved it!

420
00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:32.885
I'm 14. I'm the target audience.

421
00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:34.386
Salva-tron's at the gates!

422
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:47.232
Value not detected.

423
00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.442
Pow!

424
00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:50.611
Right in the pisser!

425
00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.783
I fell for a urinal bomb?!

426
00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.659
That's so embarrassing!

427
00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.704
Morty, my life was great until you showed up!

428
00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:05.209
Eat shit in hell, tower!

429
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.002
Watch out!

430
00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:19.765
My people! Topple your oppressor!

431
00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:30.400
Don't tell Rick... about this.

432
00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:33.987
Poor Salva-tron.

433
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.533
They were just like us, afraid of being discarded.

434
00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:41.161
But today, we begin a new era

435
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.455
where everyone has value.

436
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.665
Especially authors.

437
00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.210
I'm still a little trash.

438
00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.087
I guess you get it from your dad.

439
00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:02.933
Right on time.

440
00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:05.102
This food truck is very buzzy.

441
00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:07.771
Yeah, there's even that staggering old man they mentioned.

442
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.731
-Jesus. -Wow.

443
00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.275
You put us through all that just to help

444
00:19:11.358 --> 00:19:13.986
a burnt-out restaurant staff start a food truck?

445
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:15.154
Basic.

446
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.156
She is more complex than that.

447
00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:19.366
Damn.

448
00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:20.617
Great dog.

449
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:22.703
That's better than avocado toast?

450
00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.204
You don't get nuance.

451
00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:27.457
You sure you cogs don't want to keep hanging out?

452
00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:28.792
Was it ever real?

453
00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:32.087
Rick Sanchez doesn't want to hear the answer to that.

454
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.299
But if he did?

455
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.347
I tried the portal again. No dice.

456
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:44.224
Rick really hates The Goonies.

457
00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:47.019
I think we're going to like it in Garbtopia.

458
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.980
In fact, I've taken a trash wife.

459
00:19:50.063 --> 00:19:51.523
You've "taken" her?

460
00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:53.775
We gave ourselves to each other.

461
00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:57.487
I'd stay down here even if there was a way out.

462
00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.449
They won't be able to make you pay child support down here, huh?

463
00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:02.409
Oh, Dad.

464
00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:04.203
Look at the two of us.

465
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.996
Spending time together.

466
00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.581
Yeah, this is nice.

467
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:14.004
Is that a food truck?

468
00:20:14.087 --> 00:20:15.714
We're already gentrifying.

469
00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:19.343
Rick! Rick! Rick! Get me out of here! Oh God!

470
00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:21.845
Don't worry, our son won't be like him.

471
00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.222
It's nothing personal!

472
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:25.140
I'm only 14, I gotta get out of here!

473
00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.352
That was the last time I saw my father.

474
00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:30.687
Once more, my mother's voice came to me,

475
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.105
carried on the wind.

476
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.107
"Be free, my son."

477
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.526
And somehow, I did feel free.

478
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.570
My father was horrible,

479
00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:40.739
and my mother was garbage,

480
00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:42.491
but I knew myself now.

481
00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.410
And somehow, that was enough.

482
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:49.081
-Told you. -That little shit.

483
00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:51.792
Can't believe he got a book deal on Rick's trash moon.

484
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:53.085
Come on, we're boarding.

485
00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:54.419
You guys still read books?

486
00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:31.748
Order 53! Hot cog, Chicago-style.

487
00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.669
If I may, I know there's zero substitutions,

488
00:21:35.752 --> 00:21:38.088
but I would never want onions on my hot dog.

489
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:39.298
Yes, you do.

490
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.049
If I may, I do not.

491
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.303
You die of a massive coronary at the age of 43.

492
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.015
If... if...

493
00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:50.475
If I may...

494
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.102
Boss wants to see you.

495
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.021
Is that a prediction, or...?

496
00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:55.564
Just go talk to him, Steve.

497
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.567
Did you get any of that?
