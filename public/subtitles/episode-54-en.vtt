1
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.860
Oh, my God, I cannot fucking believe this!

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.830
Here we fucking go!

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.280
Oh! Jeez!

4
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.720
Pardon the interruption.

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.620
We are once again in the federal clear.

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.950
Rick, what the hell?! A-Are you a Turkey Dracula now?

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.790
Morty, is that a Pooplickian GamePod?

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.460
Actually it's the GamePod XL.

9
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.730
They say it's the most realistic video game console ever.

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.670
- I never got you that. - Space Mom did.

11
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.460
She's in for the holiday weekend, remember?

12
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.419
Shit, in that case, let's go, let's get out of here...

13
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.879
I heard you smack the glass, Dad.

14
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.279
- If you bail, I'll disown you! - Yeah,

15
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.599
I'd say don't hop through a portal.

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.820
But, oh, wait, you can't.

17
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.070
Look at it this way, Morty. Life is a subscription,

18
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.543
and Thanksgiving is your family's yearly charge.

19
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.640
Wow, Dad, good job.

20
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.910
Rick, put some pants on. Today has so few rules.

21
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.340
Yes, Patriarch.

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.630
Ding ding ding!

23
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.150
I'd like to make a toast.

24
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.750
Today is a day for thanks.

25
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.690
And for family.

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.854
And for remembering all of those that have less.

27
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.480
- Okay, pick a scope. - Pick a scope?

28
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.420
Can we please have a normal Thanksgiving?

29
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.939
Well, seems like all the ones I remember.

30
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.080
Good point.

31
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.540
Baby, you... It's a toast.

32
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.620
- Sorry! - Sorry!

33
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.310
Anyway, I'm thankful for my wife.

34
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.204
Beth. The Beth that chose me.

35
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.480
I'm so grateful to you,

36
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.660
and I literally could not live without you.

37
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.680
- Aw! - Aw! Aw!

38
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.799
I really mean that. If something were to happen to you,

39
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.859
or if you were to leave me, or be unfaithful,

40
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.320
- I would die. - Mm! Uh...

41
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.240
Literally. Probably by my own hand.

42
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.290
- Eww. - Okay.

43
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.540
I know how I'd do it.

44
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.370
Our first blender has an extra long cord

45
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.460
and it was manufactured before safety fuses,

46
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.940
so I'd draw a warm bath...

47
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.000
And blend some stuff. Good toast, honey.

48
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.400
To thankfulness.

49
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.300
To... A-America?

50
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.580
To ending the toast?

51
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.540
To ending the toast!

52
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.670
Just to, uh, be clear, I was saying I'd kill myself.

53
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.697
- Jerry. God! - We know!

54
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.940
Sorry Jerry got all husbandy.

55
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.820
Yeah, do not miss that.

56
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.069
So I was thinking we could set you up in Jerry's man cave?

57
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.429
Oh, that's okay, I'll sleep in my car.

58
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.850
It's got a TARDIS thing going on, bigger on the inside.

59
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.020
Dad calls it hack, but my soaking tub begs to differ.

60
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.620
Hmm, maybe I'll trade you. Ohh!

61
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.163
Agh! My lower back.

62
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.060
Oh, I got this.

63
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.200
Ah, Jesus, that was great.

64
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.480
Well, you're me.

65
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.464
I find this is usually the biggest help.

66
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.220
Mmm, oh, I just love... the Venusian stuff.

67
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.780
It's cool, I get insecure trying to pronounce this crap, too,

68
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.470
but I got just the thing for that.

69
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.850
Here.

70
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.340
_

71
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.390
_

72
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.180
_

73
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.230
Um...

74
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.360
_

75
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.090
Okay, shoot that asteroid. Now shoot that one.

76
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.170
Now shoot me in the face. This game's trash.

77
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.329
I didn't want to say anything, but this does seem lame.

78
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.699
Yeah, I thought it was maybe 'cause we've shot

79
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.710
so many real asteroids.

80
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.020
L-Let's look at the menu.

81
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.400
- Oh! T-There's the realism setting. - Oh, cool.

82
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.800
Also stupid. The factory setting is 4?

83
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.740
- What do we want, 10? - No, do 9. I'm kidding.

84
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.189
- Shut up, Summer. - Yeah, shut up, Summer.

85
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.360
Put 10.

86
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.980
- This is the same. - It's worse. It's...

87
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.759
Oh. Oh. I get it. Okay. It's... It's more real.

88
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.290
The vast majority of space is empty.

89
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.420
What? Who cares? T-Then what am I doing?

90
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.108
Looks like you can record a video for your kid in case you die.

91
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.719
Not a bad idea, you're gonna be in space for a while.

92
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.470
May as well. Um, hey, son. Uh...

93
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.660
If you're seeing this,

94
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.661
I... starved to death while looking for an asteroid.

95
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.470
Ugh. This is stupid.

96
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.779
You guys are obviously just trying to convince yourselves it's cool

97
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.020
because you feel lame about it.

98
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.310
Summer you know nothing about gamer culture.

99
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.859
Bro, tell your son you love the shit out of him.

100
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.963
Oh, I'm gonna!

101
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.240
Of course we both can't sleep at the same time.

102
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.360
Yeah, we do share a shitty back.

103
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.730
- Turn around. At least let me... - Yes, please.

104
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.480
Oh, my God.

105
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Okay, I know we're not massage people, but you need this.

106
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.640
See, you act like this badass space cowboy,

107
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.930
but I know you're just a scared little overachiever

108
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.324
that keeps all her OCD right...

109
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.480
- Oh, my God! - Yeah.

110
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.840
By the way you better be taking notes... I'm next.

111
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.310
It's my back, you dumb bitch.

112
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.020
Nice.

113
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.200
What?

114
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.779
Well, I better get back to bed.

115
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.900
Yep. Same.

116
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.476
Oh, so now you're into highly realistic video games?

117
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.670
Maybe I decided real life was too much right now,

118
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.870
or maybe I'm not afraid to change my mind about stuff.

119
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.080
Maybe mental flexibility is stronger than stubbornness.

120
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.680
Nice manip', Sum-Sum.

121
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.490
Okay, I-I'm in the alley behind the library.

122
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.620
- Uptown or downtown? - Shit, there's one uptown, too?

123
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.409
It's okay, stay there, I think I'm near the red line.

124
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.880
Is this "Street Fighter"?

125
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.759
"Street Fighter" where you start at the beginning

126
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.140
of each fighter's day and have to find each other to fight.

127
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.220
It's very realistic.

128
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.839
Not even guaranteed a fight will happen.

129
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.570
That meter filling up is us forgetting what made us so mad.

130
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.200
If anyone's interested in a higher level of realism,

131
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.090
I'm booting up the OG...

132
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.840
that's Original Game, called a jigsaw puzzle... in the den.

133
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.550
Hey, gang!

134
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.989
Me and my space self are gonna make a run

135
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.770
to the Gloppy Drop System for ice cream.

136
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.894
- Any flavor requests? - Vanilla!

137
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.020
Why do you guys have to go all the way to deep space

138
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.150
just for ice cream?

139
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.580
Gloppy Dropulites have less taste buds than humans.

140
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.320
Their ice cream is like a hospital bed.

141
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.612
It's designed for you to do less so it does more.

142
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.697
Okay, see ya in a bit.

143
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.260
I'll get started sorting all the obvious sky pieces.

144
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.280
Secret technique.

145
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.419
- Oh, shit, there you are! - Oh, fuck, it's on, bitch!

146
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.209
- I'm gonna eat your ass! - You will die in the street

147
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.705
like a dog!

148
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.126
Stunning.

149
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.440
Thank you. This is incredible.

150
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.070
Eh. Just glad I had something in your size.

151
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.440
How far is Gloppy Drop?

152
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.100
And why do I always think I'm wearing a watch?

153
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.690
I actually have a pint of Gloppy Drop

154
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.450
on a little apartment orbiting Earth.

155
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.780
So we have time.

156
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.780
You have your own space station?

157
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.355
We have our own space station.

158
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.780
- We're the same person. - There's differences.

159
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.060
Like, one of us has no idea who she really is.

160
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.630
Wrong. But let's make a deal.

161
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.600
Let's trust ourselves enough to stop wondering

162
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.115
who we are when we're together.

163
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.890
We get to say anything to each other.

164
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.930
Things we'd never say to anyone else, even ourselves.

165
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.039
What don't we say to ourselves?

166
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.501
How about, "Wow, my ass looks good in that space suit"?

167
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.624
I mean it. I'm a good-looking woman.

168
00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.310
Well, that's nice of you to say.

169
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.677
I also... find myself... quite attractive.

170
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.160
We forgot the ice cream.

171
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.400
I want you back in my guts

172
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.652
like I'm one of your sick little fillies.

173
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.700
Oh, God damn it, Morty!

174
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.240
You can't just take my controller.

175
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.800
Yes, I can! It's mine!

176
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.520
- Ugh. Okay, Sum-Sum, gimme. - Make your own controller,

177
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.199
some of us need all the control we can get.

178
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.660
Ugh, fuck you!

179
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.260
So why are you so suddenly into realistic video games?

180
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.280
I already was.

181
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.320
Yeah, but now you're into them the way I am.

182
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.370
You mean, like staring at them in a numb trance?

183
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.890
Uh-huh. Not judging, just noticing.

184
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.600
Yeah, y-you tend to notice stuff a little before I do.

185
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.000
But eventually you do notice.

186
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.430
And now we can both not notice together, yes.

187
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.273
Oh, my God... Beth!

188
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.830
I thought you said you got ice cream?

189
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.799
Yeah, I, uh... It must be in the, uh...

190
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.780
Oh, the car! We left it in the car.

191
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.610
Okay, good, because that would have been weird!

192
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.880
I worry things might become more and more noticeable.

193
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.029
Yeah, and if he kills himself,

194
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.219
we're gonna have to get a new dad.

195
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.788
Jesus Christ, Summer!

196
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.340
Hey, Dad.

197
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.200
Um, hmm, what's this?

198
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.220
Making a controller.

199
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.660
This species of bionic space whale has carbon wiring,

200
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.230
great for smooth gameplay.

201
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.760
I'm not killing it, for the record.

202
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.030
I'm just replacing its esophagus with a better one.

203
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.040
For free. I-It should thank me.

204
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.520
And it will, with its mind.

205
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.779
These things are telepathic, Beth.

206
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.060
They talk to you in dreams.

207
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.540
Does your replicator thing make ice cream

208
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.040
from the Gloppy Drop system?

209
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.990
Why would you want replicated Gloppy Drop ice cream, poser?

210
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.600
Crazy thing. I went with Space Beth to get some,

211
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.620
and we had such a great time we forgot the ice cream!

212
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.250
- Crazy, right? - That's a real question?

213
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.360
M-Maybe?

214
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.160
Come here, hold the pup down.

215
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.840
You're talking about an infinite father.

216
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.830
I've met myself out there infinite times.

217
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.380
Infinite shit happens.

218
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.800
Including, as you put it, forgetting the ice cream.

219
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.820
You've... forgotten the ice cream?

220
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.480
Drill me for details when I'm drunker.

221
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.960
In the meantime, don't worry about what's crazy.

222
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.580
You know, as the kids say, you do you.

223
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.000
Oh, thanks. Thank you so much, Dad.

224
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.319
One thing to keep in mind, though.

225
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.169
It's not just your own ice cream you're forgetting.

226
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.180
It's your family's.

227
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.689
If you forget it too much, you start having to keep secrets.

228
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.270
Oh, and you're against secrets?

229
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.250
Against? Hell no. Secrets are great.

230
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.900
For instance, I've had a pint of vanilla Gloppy Drop

231
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.120
in my fridge this whole time.

232
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.240
Take it. I'm just saying, lies pile up.

233
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.360
Like credit card debt.

234
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.240
You retain an advantage by staying liquid.

235
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.120
Gotcha. Well...

236
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.203
I'd call this a simple cash transaction.

237
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.831
Fun and done.

238
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.580
Favorite Culkin.

239
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.979
- Kieran! - Kieran!

240
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.092
Favorite song by Britney.

241
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.119
- "Work Bitch"! - "Work Bitch"!

242
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.136
Favorite hangover cure.

243
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.739
- Hair of the dog with a guilty pleasure - Hair of the dog with a guilty pleasure

244
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.420
- like "Humans Weekly." - like "Us Weekly."

245
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.360
I told Dad.

246
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.160
I mean, I didn't have to. He knew.

247
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.060
I guess that's one reason you didn't have to tell him.

248
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.060
What'd he say?

249
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.580
We kind of talked in code, I think he said it's fine

250
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.200
until it makes us feel indebted to our lessers.

251
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.540
That sounds like Dad.

252
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.960
Do we owe... the family an explanation?

253
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.600
Do we have to spend our time together

254
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.060
figuring out how to please others?

255
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.140
I'm married.

256
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.160
We both are, but I'm in our marriage.

257
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.500
It's the defining difference between us.

258
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.980
Well, there's no rule book that says you have to be.

259
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.060
What's gonna happen?

260
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.690
What is this? Are we in love...

261
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.160
with ourself?

262
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.550
I mean, does that make us the most

263
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.740
or the least healthy woman in the universe?

264
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.895
Anybody ever tell you you're overly analytical?

265
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.880
Which I do love.

266
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.340
If that's what you need to call it.

267
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.370
I don't need to call it anything.

268
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.040
I would like to know... its shelf life.

269
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.531
I might know a way to gather that data.

270
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.700
- Motel room! - The Holodeck!

271
00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.367
I like yours better.

272
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.980
Hmm... Uh...

273
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.540
Beth! Uh, m-my Beth!

274
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.460
Well, not "my" Beth, but... I finished!

275
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.920
It's done!

276
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.600
Kids, do you know where your moms are?

277
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.820
Oh, you're busy with your GamePod.

278
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.890
Don't worry about it, I'll find those two somewhere.

279
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.642
No! No, Dad, um, come play video games with us!

280
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.120
Okay, Dad, here's the infinite menu screen.

281
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.395
Oh, I dunno.

282
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.981
Here, here, I-I'll have the console choose a game!

283
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.140
_

284
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.540
Um, maybe let's skip this one?

285
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.526
Really? Why? Looks fun!

286
00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.199
_

287
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.750
Oh, okay, so we are a woman married to a man,

288
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.920
but having a sexual affair with another woman!

289
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.380
Very spicy.

290
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.580
Very spicy, Jer. G-Good job.

291
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.124
Looks pretty single player, kids?

292
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.757
Seriously, you two?!

293
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.134
What the hell did you do in my Holodeck?!

294
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.060
Holy shit, you... you did a full "San Junipero" in here?

295
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.730
Oh, my God, Beth, there's masturbating

296
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.640
and then there's masturbating.

297
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.769
- Ew, Dad, stop, I'm sorry! - You'd know, old man.

298
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.760
Argh! Look, this isn't my business,

299
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.470
and by all means, enjoy being sapphic horse girls together.

300
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.180
But you suck at doing it secretly.

301
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.500
- We all know. - Including Jerry?!

302
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.880
No, Dad's so in the dark that he's enjoying a video game

303
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.239
about being in an affair right now.

304
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.939
If you guys are doing this, you got to tell him!

305
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.380
Okay, little man, back off.

306
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.480
- Take it easy. They're right. - Right about what,

307
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.320
that we have to be twice as considerate

308
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.581
and twice as repressed

309
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.650
because some dick split us in two?

310
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.878
This is the shit I left. This isn't. This is me.

311
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.140
This is the me that doesn't tell you all to fuck off.

312
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.040
So allow me. Fuck off.

313
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.620
She'll tell her husband what she wants when she feels like it.

314
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.559
And you can deal with it or you can deal with me.

315
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.400
But you should know I have all the Predator weapons.

316
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.759
- Works for me. - That's cool.

317
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.811
- Fair enough. - I guess it's time for ice cream.

318
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.420
Come on, kids, you're inhaling this stuff.

319
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.950
Your Moms went to space.

320
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.526
Did you even thank them for doing it?

321
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.920
Thanks for... doing it, Moms.

322
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.323
Very selfless of you.

323
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.060
Eat your ice cream however you want.

324
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.451
Nothing good lasts forever.

325
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.190
_

326
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.040
_

327
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.480
Okay, come on, it's Thanksgiving.

328
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.000
The least we can do is speak English.

329
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.580
Jerry, I had sex with your wife.

330
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.680
Or I'm your wife and had sex with the clone you sleep with.

331
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.719
Your pick. We had sex. We loved it.

332
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.265
Beth Sanchez sure is something, huh?

333
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.680
I think I'll ask her to prom.

334
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.800
Jerry, for your own sake, stay away from Beth Sanchez.

335
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.080
Worst case, she says "no."

336
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.560
No, Jerry. Worst case she says "yes."

337
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.360
She's too much woman for you.

338
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.100
Yeah, maybe she'd find your simple naivetÃ© endearing,

339
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.220
but she's intense.

340
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.199
Sooner or later, she'd tear you apart.

341
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.453
I'd be lucky to be torn apart by Beth Sanchez.

342
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.599
- Aah! - What the fuck?!

343
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.140
Dad's a bug! Dad rolled into a bug!

344
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.320
Oh, yeah. Sh... Forgot I installed that.

345
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.000
Why does Jerry have a Pill Bug Protocol?

346
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.400
It's an emotional defense system.

347
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.763
I got drunk with Jerry one night

348
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.339
and he said it's what he wanted most in the world.

349
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.517
Don't blame me, I wanted tattoos.

350
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.899
Anyway, he's in perfect health in there

351
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.199
and he can unroll when he chooses to,

352
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.280
but can also stay in metabolic hibernation pretty much indefinitely.

353
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.359
It's a cool power to have, like if you have to fly coach

354
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.949
or if Summer asks you what you thought of "Wonder Woman 1984."

355
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.750
- How do we undo it? - Only he can.

356
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.220
That's the point. It's total safety. Even I can't reverse it.

357
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.749
If you try to pry him out and hit a nerve,

358
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.280
he'll literally turn into a Shrek.

359
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.538
In his own sad way, he's taken control.

360
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.080
This is classic Jerry.

361
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.300
He'd rather be a bug than have a conversation.

362
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.259
Oh, have you heard the way you start conversations?

363
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.780
You ladies discuss responsibility

364
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.464
while I get stoned and play video games with your kids.

365
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.760
_

366
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.138
_

367
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.560
_

368
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.060
- Fuck! More forest! - L-Look around!

369
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.686
_

370
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.589
_

371
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.640
Try heading north.

372
00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.680
_

373
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.200
_

374
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.599
_

375
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.899
- Oh, shit. - Wait, what the fuck?

376
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.940
Um, maybe keep heading north?

377
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.400
_

378
00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.760
_

379
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.819
_

380
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.200
- Ew, what the hell? - Oh, God,

381
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.955
w-what happens in the shadows?

382
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.330
Jerry, sweetie, if you can hear me, please unroll.

383
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.680
He doesn't want to.

384
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.837
It's a little late to worry about what he wants.

385
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.620
Jesus, Beth, don't fall for this.

386
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.132
This isn't love, it's a tantrum.

387
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.440
Yeah, but his tantrum is self-destructive.

388
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.940
Yours is destructive.

389
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.720
Maybe that's why I'm the one that loves him.

390
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.560
He worries. He wants to do right.

391
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.420
He's ashamed when he fails.

392
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.480
Aren't those things you love about me?

393
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.820
You want me to be like him? You want me to propose?

394
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.240
Threaten to kill myself?

395
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.280
No. I love you the way you are.

396
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.709
And I did it forever in a video game. But in life, things go wrong.

397
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.719
Things stop working.

398
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.600
I-I like to fix those things, and when I can't,

399
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.720
I'm pretty useless.

400
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.820
Like my husband.

401
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.840
I don't get it. You're the house wife and I'm the space lady,

402
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.980
but you're the one that chewed me up and spit me out.

403
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.180
I don't want to just forget about you.

404
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.120
Me neither. It's a problem.

405
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.088
But we know someone that owes us a solution.

406
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.170
Oh, shit, we're out of the forest.

407
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.639
- We found a clearing. - Go check it out!

408
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.052
Go check out the clearing!

409
00:16:09.053 --> 00:16:10.345
_

410
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.400
_

411
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.999
_

412
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.680
Vampires?! Oh, come on! That's not realistic!

413
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.140
Morty, it's obviously set in a world

414
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.879
- where vampires hunt in clearings. - How did you...

415
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.939
I'm working with the same information you are!

416
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.210
- Ow! - No more screen time

417
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.900
until your homework's done, Dad.

418
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.660
- What did that mean? - We refuse to care.

419
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.080
Damn. You really came of age this Thanksgiving.

420
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.160
How old are we?

421
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.076
We've had a million Thanksgivings.

422
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.820
Can I explain how irrational this is?

423
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.860
Asked the guy that cloned his daughter.

424
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.082
- Will I ever live that down? - No.

425
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.599
You guys are having me "Eternal Sunshine"

426
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.680
all the "Multiplicity" porn scenes from your minds?

427
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.959
- Yep. Basically. - Sounds right.

428
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.400
Meanwhile, everyone around you...

429
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.980
your father, your cuckhold husband,

430
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.320
your jaded children... will just happily and silently bear the burden

431
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.389
because it's more practical for them than the truth

432
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.339
and you don't care because it won't be your problem?

433
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.440
Solid repipe, Dad.

434
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.020
It's like he has a lifetime of experience as a selfish ass.

435
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.730
_

436
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.489
When this fails and the two of you fall in love again

437
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.180
and you attack me for taking part in this,

438
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.339
I'm gonna lie and say I tried to talk you out of it for hours.

439
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.580
In truth, I don't care.

440
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.406
- Three, two... - Oh, for God's sakes,

441
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.660
all of you, grow up.

442
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.899
- Jerry! You unrolled! - What the hell?!

443
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.699
Ooh, plot twist, Deus Ex Husbanda.

444
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.371
Oh, don't lobotomize yourselves for my comfort.

445
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.330
I may be a man, but I'm also a baby,

446
00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:23.170
and babies don't take responsibility for other people's suffering.

447
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.610
I should never have said I'd kill myself if you left me.

448
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.239
It's not true. All I'd do is pack my shit and cry

449
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.259
while I look for a job on Starbucks Wi-Fi.

450
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.760
And that's what I'm gonna do.

451
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.800
So the two of you can get clone lesbian married

452
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.500
by a robot and finger yourselves on the moon

453
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.780
while laughing in Martian French about my weird little dick!

454
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.061
Jerry, wait!

455
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.760
Jerry, don't leave angry.

456
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.380
Should I float out on a lotus leaf?

457
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.940
I have to be twice as confident

458
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.040
because my wife cheated on me with herself?

459
00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.360
It's not even cheating.

460
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.994
Oh, you here to help? You suck.

461
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
You don't even know which one is your real wife.

462
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.300
If it's me, have you been cheating with a clone?

463
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.125
I'm not the clone, but she has a point.

464
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.860
Oh, what a provocative conversation it would've been great to have

465
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.370
before the two of you...

466
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.980
and I am counting two...

467
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.640
gave each other unfairly expert orgasms

468
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.385
while mocking my weird little dick!

469
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.619
Jerry, you're the only one who keeps saying "weird" and "little."

470
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.740
Well, you've both seen it!

471
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.899
And you've both seen each other,

472
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.600
and now you want to tell me all about it,

473
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.620
but it's a little late.

474
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.900
Oh, my God.

475
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.399
You're not mad that it was about you.

476
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.920
You're mad that it wasn't.

477
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.120
He wanted to permit our love.

478
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.170
Okay, it's not "Handmaid's Tale" to loop in your husband.

479
00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.839
I agree, for the record. We made a mistake.

480
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.600
Oh, because we should've noticed ourselves losing control

481
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.300
and gone to Sexmaster Jerry and said, "Oh, pretty please, Jerry,

482
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.871
- can I make out with myself?" - Yes, you may.

483
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.000
Yeah, see. Not so hot when it's aboveboard, home-wreckers.

484
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.800
Oh, so we won't enjoy this?

485
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.540
Well, hold on, hold on, this is weird.

486
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.963
Weird and permitted.

487
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.280
- Wait, you like this? - Who cares what he likes.

488
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.000
- I do. - I might like it.

489
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.886
And if she likes it, I permit it.

490
00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.100
- You little pervert. - You like a little pervert.

491
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.220
I like humiliating a little pervert.

492
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.960
I approve. Carry on.

493
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.390
I'm freaked out by how hot this is.

494
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.160
Am I permitted to do this?

495
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.690
Until further notice.

496
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.820
- I love it. - Then it's permitted from now on.

497
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.900
Oh, because you like whatever she likes.

498
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.470
Because you're a worm.

499
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.070
I will allow that assessment.

500
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.920
- Pass the salt? - I don't care what you allow.

501
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.049
- Damn it! - What do you allow?

502
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.090
I allow this.

503
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.399
Well, then it's required.

504
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.949
I approve the requirement.

505
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.560
- You get over there. - Good idea.

506
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.120
Oh, wow. Okay.

507
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.750
- Uh, Honey? - I'm fine if you are.

508
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.420
- You're never fine, shut up. - Okay, but... Whoa! Okay.

509
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.980
- This is not how I pictured this, but... - I have zero complaints so far.

510
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.640
Because I know what you want.

511
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.260
I do not disagree with that.

512
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.120
Can I make a pitch? What if we...

513
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.369
Are you serious?

514
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.200
Hey, is... is this making fun of me?

515
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.360
- Well, is that bad? - I'll allow it.

516
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.739
Jesus Christ, you need to fix the portal gun, Rick!

517
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.870
Morty, you asking makes me want to do it less.

518
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.170
Okay, uh, Thanksgiving!

519
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.940
L-L-Let's talk about Thanksgiving!

520
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.780
Who's thankful for what? Go, Summer, y-you first.

521
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.880
Um, I guess I'm thankful, for like, water?

522
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.820
Perfect! Wonderful! Morty, w-what about you?

523
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.320
F-F-Fucking... Are you fucking kidding me?

524
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.720
Why? Why? Discovery Channel!

525
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.620
Discovery Channel, why?!

526
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.200
Okay. Just eat your food.

527
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.920
Ea-Ea... Everyone eat the food.

528
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.700
Sorry, I'm... Is this? Ooh!

529
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.200
Well, bye, kids!

530
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.512
I'll keep an eye out for my grandkid in space.

531
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.470
Your what? Oh, right. "Naruto."

532
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.600
Thanks for visiting, Space Beth.

533
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.810
Well, seems like we all learned a little lesson this weekend!

534
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.380
At least, I know I did.

535
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.488
Me, too, Jerry. Me, too.

536
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.630
Hello there, Jerry! How can I help you today?

537
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.930
Howdy! Yeah, just, uh... just here to hang!

538
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.600
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

539
00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.400
You can't come here by yourself.

540
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.370
Why not? It's just me in there!

541
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.970
Well, not that this is something you'd do,

542
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.310
but sometimes we have Jerries come here

543
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.500
and try to touch other Jerries.

544
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.810
Oh, no, that's... that's not good.

545
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.887
Uh, well, see you later!

546
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.600
Okay. Thank you.
