1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.399
Rick, I-I'm not rated to climb something this sheer.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.539
Look, you're the guy that wanted an epic adventure.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.539
I'm the guy with only one hover chair.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.769
Goddammit, an alien spider just bit my finger!

5
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.889
It's an alien cliff.

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.210
You can just say spider.

7
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.439
You couldn't do that an hour ago?

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.209
I was eating, and you're dirty.

9
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.919
Activate anti-booby suits.

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.142
Total waste of snakes.

11
00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:40.459
If you want to take a beat

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.139
to acknowledge the sacred atmosphere,

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.839
it could give the cynical grave robbing

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.859
a hint of irreverence.

15
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.299
- No, I'm... I'm good. - All right, then.

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.590
Let's loop this corpse.

17
00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.379
Hey, where's the...

18
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.859
Wait, what?

19
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.099
Is that an origami horse?

20
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.439
It's a calling card from Miles Knightley,

21
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.039
a heist artist,

22
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.359
AKA a hipster dick

23
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.699
whose adventures are 60% putting a crew together

24
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.779
and 40% revealing that the robbery already happened,

25
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.919
and he's not worth our time

26
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.259
because he's a hack piece of shit!

27
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.239
[BLEEP] I'm gonna kill him! Let's go, Morty.

28
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.599
This temple's for [BLEEP] lame baby dipshits.

29
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.499
Who disturbs my slumber?

30
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.579
Also, who rigs a tomb to crush the buried person?

31
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.684
Isn't the point to protect... Aah!

32
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080
_

33
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.019
This dork. He has a convention now?

34
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.139
Come on. What are we doing?

35
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.419
Huh! Tuxedo scuba lessons? Ooh!

36
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.979
A signing with Catherines Alpha through Omega Joneses!

37
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.479
You know, this is great source material

38
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.849
for this heist movie that I'm writing.

39
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.579
Don't get drawn into the culture, Morty.

40
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.060
Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing.

41
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.520
Where is the entrance?

42
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.031
Oh, brother.

43
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.994
More like Trying Too Hard Con.

44
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.494
Guests or professionals?

45
00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:24.899
- Uh, guests. - Uh... Uh, guests are fans, Morty,

46
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.299
which we are not. We'd like professional badges.

47
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.879
- Do you have a crew? - Yes.

48
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.669
He's a getaway driver with Asperger's,

49
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.919
and my butthole is a demolitions expert.

50
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.199
How much is it to get in?

51
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.099
If you want professional badges,

52
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.424
you need to put a crew together.

53
00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:39.419
Or we could sneak in like professionals.

54
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.349
- Can't wait. - Whoa!

55
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.549
Oh, for God's sake.

56
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.771
And you wonder why we aren't fans.

57
00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:49.559
Let that ointment sit for 10 minutes or you'll die.

58
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.159
Don't let it sit for 12

59
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.899
or I'll have to hunt down what you become.

60
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.559
Can't you just buy a guest badge?

61
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.679
[BLEEP] you for asking, Morty.

62
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.099
That would be a symbolic expression

63
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.659
of support for this genre.

64
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.739
Then how do we get in?

65
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.169
With a little help from some old friends.

66
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.039
Rick Sanchez, you son of a bitch!

67
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.979
Need some people for a thing, Glar.

68
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.799
My name's Gleer these days.

69
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.249
I play piano.

70
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.239
Hey, Gleer. Play your piano.

71
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.580
I quit! Augh!

72
00:03:18.803 --> 00:03:22.139
And the name's Glar!

73
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.309
Sanchez, you son of a bitch.

74
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.419
Never thought I'd see Angie Flint

75
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.839
picking ticks off a pig.

76
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.359
Nobody's hiring an ex-con

77
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.361
with fake hands to build an ion engine.

78
00:03:36.362 --> 00:03:39.060
Suppose I had a job that didn't care if you'd done time

79
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.959
or whatever's going on with your confusing-ass hands.

80
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.699
I'm in.

81
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.299
Is this the guy?

82
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.819
No.

83
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.680
- That the guy? - Nope.

84
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.519
- Him? - No.

85
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.839
No, wait. Y-Yes.

86
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.048
Yeah, of course that's the guy.

87
00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.659
Hey... Hey, Truckula!

88
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.799
You son of a bitch! I'm in!

89
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.139
Thanks for doing this, guys.

90
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.607
- It's the job. - That was it. Bye.

91
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.109
And then, the police stole the paintings

92
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.219
because the police were us in police outfits.

93
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.239
Thank you!

94
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.839
It's showtime, Morty,

95
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.739
and I don't mean a bad impression of HBO.

96
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.639
I mean, "Time for a show."

97
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.039
Another heist question from a fan?

98
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.209
Uh, how about a rhetorical one

99
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.754
from someone that had to be reminded that you exist?

100
00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:37.660
Hey, pal! That's not the question line!

101
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.399
Lab coat... Ripoff Dr. Strange.

102
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.919
Wha...

103
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.069
Rick Sanchez, everyone. Smartest man in the universe.

104
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.539
And a savage critic of the heisting arts.

105
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.939
Your boos mean nothing!

106
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.187
I've seen what makes you cheer!

107
00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:53.979
My question is, "Seriously?"

108
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.619
Lab coat... end ripoff.

109
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.679
Aah!

110
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.019
You stole the gem I needed to split tachyons

111
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.779
and probably fenced it so the 80 people

112
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.739
that did all the work could each buy a beer.

113
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.573
You're not an artist, you're Postmates.

114
00:05:04.574 --> 00:05:07.299
I doubt this rivalry can be settled with words.

115
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.759
Why don't we make things interesting?

116
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.139
I challenge you to a heist of the crystal skull of Horowitz.

117
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.499
In a heist off!

118
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.949
That doesn't make things interesting.

119
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.719
It makes them "Ocean's Twelve," by far the worst one.

120
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.859
Every breath I take without your permission

121
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.460
raises my self-esteem!

122
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.879
State your terms.

123
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.919
First crew to heist the skull wins.

124
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.579
The other endures heist culture's greatest shame.

125
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.419
They must join the winning crew.

126
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.189
Lame. I accept.

127
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.019
Please welcome Knightley's Eight!

128
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.649
Snake Arms! Double Microwave!

129
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.439
Monitor Lord! Key Catcher!

130
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.619
The Shape Shiftress! Angie Flint!

131
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.609
- Glar! And Truckula. - Hey!

132
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.719
Half of Knightley's Eight

133
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.599
are just three of Sanchez's Five!

134
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.999
Well, no heist is complete without a double cross,

135
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.739
and I had the perfect job.

136
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.549
Heisting the crystal skull.

137
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.349
That was it. Bye.

138
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.789
Looks like you're available for a job.

139
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.779
With Rick Sanchez on my team, I'll be unstoppable.

140
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.779
Rick, welcome to Knightley's Nine.

141
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.749
Ugh, ugh!

142
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.219
Ugh! Rick, for real?

143
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.859
Eh. You got that skull, buddy?

144
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.640
What? How?

145
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.369
With a little help from some old friends.

146
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.069
_

147
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.460
Heistotron, state your prime directive?

148
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.479
To heist.

149
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.659
Calculate Miles Knightley's current heist plan

150
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.539
and add one double-cross with a switcheroo.

151
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.259
Compiling crew members most likely to double-cross.

152
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.720
God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you?

153
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.279
Rick, I-I want to say goodbye.

154
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.089
Don't turn around. I'll explain later.

155
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.911
Looks like you're available for a job.

156
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.660
Your skills are required for a job.

157
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.959
You son of a bitch. I'm in.

158
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.169
Man, this is really coming together.

159
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.979
You know, Rick, I've been busy working on writing...

160
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.399
A heist script. Yeah, you almost never bring it up.

161
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.769
Oh, [BLEEP] we... we should head over.

162
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.099
Hey, guys. What do you got?

163
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.109
Pretty!

164
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.359
Morty, put this in your backpack.

165
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.929
Grandpa's gonna run to the bathroom.

166
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.839
Ugh. Wasn't even a heist.

167
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.979
All you did was...

168
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.620
Write an algorithm based on two heist movies I slept through

169
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.339
and used it to automate a joyless process you call art?

170
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.109
Yeah, I really did, didn't I?

171
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.859
So I'm in your crew now?

172
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.699
Yeah, well, you're in good company.

173
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.199
Right, everybody?

174
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.359
Yes.

175
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.739
My God.

176
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.780
Your skills are required for a job.

177
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.119
You son of a bitch.

178
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.239
- I'm in. - What?

179
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.379
Your skills are required for a job.

180
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.279
No, they aren't.

181
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.589
You son of a bitch. I'm in.

182
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.379
Your skills are required for a job.

183
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.799
Sanchez's 3,329?

184
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.932
Yes.

185
00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:17.289
Your next big score...

186
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.389
Steal every square inch of Heistcon.

187
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.689
Oh! Ah!

188
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.379
Oh, my God. Hey! That's my wallet! Oh, God!

189
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.539
Oh, my God! Jesus. Oh, my God.

190
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.839
Oh, [BLEEP]!

191
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.139
Holy [BLEEP]. Alright.

192
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.039
Look, Morty, I did not know that that was gonna happen.

193
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.579
That's not on me. Come on, Morty. Let's go.

194
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.119
Good job, Heistotron.

195
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.709
Ah! Go ahead and shut down.

196
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.253
- Negative. - Excuse me?

197
00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:50.759
I am programmed to always be looking for the next big score.

198
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.959
You're programmed to do as I say.

199
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.959
I am programmed to double-cross.

200
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.763
You're not programmed to double-cross me.

201
00:08:56.764 --> 00:08:59.643
If I were, it wouldn't be much of a double-cross.

202
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.519
You son of a bitch. I'm in.

203
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.149
I'm in! I'm in!

204
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.539
What's the job? I'm in.

205
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.939
I'm out! I quit!

206
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.154
Whose kidneys are these?

207
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.489
Rick, w-what's happening?

208
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.419
Heistotron's gone rogue. If we don't stop them,

209
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.209
all sentient life will be absorbed

210
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.619
by the never-ending assembly of a meaningless crew.

211
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.699
That's my hell, Morty.

212
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.040
I hate heists so much,

213
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.915
and the crew assemblies are the worst part!

214
00:09:24.916 --> 00:09:26.489
Oh! How are we gonna stop it?

215
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.870
With a little help from some old friends.

216
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:37.100
Oooo, weee!

217
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.739
Before this semester's over,

218
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.959
you're gonna be real sick of that phrase.

219
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.639
So. Who here thinks they already know

220
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.349
the work of Maya Angelou?

221
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.800
Ooo wee?

222
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.739
Ooo wee wa!

223
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.419
Ah, ooo wee!

224
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.239
Told you, Morty.

225
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.659
He's still got it.

226
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.599
You sons of bitches.

227
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.869
What's the job?

228
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.799
You son of a bitch.

229
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.019
We got a job, Hephaestus,

230
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.641
and there's no time to argue about it.

231
00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:22.399
I work in a volcano.

232
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.853
What jobs do you think I've ever turned down?

233
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.849
Excuse me! Are you Veltriloquiver?

234
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.459
Rick Sanchez, I presume.

235
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.260
Wow. As advertised.

236
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.399
A "yes" would've sufficed.

237
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.819
Guys, you're doing a great job

238
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.329
getting these new Tusklas out the door,

239
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.420
and we owe it all to everyone's input.

240
00:10:45.499 --> 00:10:46.999
Elon Tusk.

241
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.199
Listen, we need your help.

242
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.259
Rick. Morty. Why me?

243
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.631
Did something happen to Elon Musk in your own reality?

244
00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:55.659
No, no, no, he's fine, but this is a team oper-ation,

245
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.843
and regular Elon can be a little bit controlling.

246
00:10:57.844 --> 00:11:01.019
Growing up with tusks did pose social challenges.

247
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.419
It's possible overcoming them

248
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.059
raised my self-esteem and incentivized collaboration.

249
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.889
Yeah, or you're less sure of yourself

250
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.979
because you have monster teeth.

251
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.419
An equally valid theory.

252
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.290
Let's talk over here.

253
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.519
How serious is the situation?

254
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.599
Incredibly serious, and every minute counts.

255
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.629
In that case, I'm sorry

256
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.029
I made you move over here for no reason.

257
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.099
Well, yeah. That was a little weird.

258
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.199
It's exactly that kind of shit

259
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.709
that made us worry about regular Elon.

260
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.219
Well, we're not opposites, okay?

261
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.479
I'm just him with tusks.

262
00:11:29.627 --> 00:11:32.169
Casing of planet initiated.

263
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.419
Hello there.

264
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.959
We are just here to check your water pressure.

265
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.765
Hmm. Interesting intel.

266
00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:46.339
It appears some giant hidden camera

267
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.979
has been dropped on the planet,

268
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.379
killing an estimated total of 57,000.

269
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.939
Executing heist.

270
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.519
People of Brandenplot,

271
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.949
we are here to deliver that pizza you ordered.

272
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.819
Well, if that's how you really feel,

273
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.020
I guess I should take the pizza back.

274
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.829
I think we got away with it.

275
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.059
Commencing getting out of here before they get wise.

276
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.392
Assembling calling card.

277
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.779
At this point, Heistotron has become large enough

278
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.309
to heist entire planets.

279
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.379
Wouldn't this be better with a blueprint on the table?

280
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.570
Blueprints are plans, Elon Tusk,

281
00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:41.919
and whatever we plan will be canceled out

282
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.785
by Heistotron's reveal that our plan was part of its plan.

283
00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:47.829
That's why I picked this crew at random

284
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.084
and why all of us will be taking our orders from Randotron.

285
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.899
Let's get ready to not rumble.

286
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.529
Bet you didn't see that coming.

287
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.699
Instead of two heist movies I slept through,

288
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.539
Randotron's algorithm is derived

289
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.539
from the plots of three David Lynch movies

290
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.722
I pretended to like to make my friends shut up.

291
00:13:05.723 --> 00:13:08.679
If our collective behavior is just random enough,

292
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.679
we should be able to walk through Heistotron's

293
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.103
lazily contrived bull[BLEEP] like it's not even there.

294
00:13:13.104 --> 00:13:15.139
- Sounds good. - I don't really get it,

295
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.059
but it sounds like that's the point.

296
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.879
So you didn't need a blacksmith?

297
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.069
We're ready when you are, Rick.

298
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.529
It's important our non-plan starts randomly,

299
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.159
so we have to wait until we're not ready.

300
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.260
W-Well, how long will that take?

301
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.959
Obviously, we can't know that.

302
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.559
Can we do things while we wait?

303
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.319
Yes. I'm gonna play Minecraft.

304
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.369
Oh, my kids play that.

305
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.070
I don't like these little jabs you get in, Elon.

306
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.879
Strange.

307
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.699
Considering the time, Cassiopeia's primary star

308
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.090
should be collinear with Orion and Ursa Minor.

309
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.249
You don't shoot arrows that carry your voice

310
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.879
without picking up a little astronomy.

311
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.179
Wait a minute.

312
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.351
Jesus, no.

313
00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:53.919
No! No! We've already been heisted!

314
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.231
How could Heistotron heist us if he's not even here yet?

315
00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:57.599
He's already been here!

316
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.679
We've been watching a recorded sky on playback.

317
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.059
Hello, Rick.

318
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.480
_

319
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.529
- Okay, guys, change of plans. - Random time detected.

320
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.119
No, Randotron, it's not a good time!

321
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.399
That's why it's random.

322
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.499
Ooh!

323
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.589
21?

324
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.799
22?

325
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.589
Oooo weee, oooo weee, sold!

326
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.400
Oooo weee, that little hunk of meat's going home to pappy!

327
00:15:11.432 --> 00:15:13.224
I've been expecting you, Rick.

328
00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:15.349
But not like this, right?

329
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.519
It hardly matters.

330
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.170
Oh, yeah. Does this?

331
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.629
No. Your randomness does not confuse me.

332
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.654
You are here now.

333
00:15:25.655 --> 00:15:27.199
That was the plan.

334
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.749
I know. It was part of mine, too.

335
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.073
I've got something to tell you.

336
00:15:31.074 --> 00:15:34.059
Let me guess. When you invented me and Randotron,

337
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.247
you swapped our brains.

338
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.399
That's right, buddy.

339
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.295
You're not the one that's very good at planning.

340
00:15:41.296 --> 00:15:43.462
You've been making this [BLEEP] up the whole time.

341
00:15:43.463 --> 00:15:45.966
Rick, I think there's something you should know.

342
00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:49.139
God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you?

343
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.839
That is something I should know,

344
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.015
or at least something I should have predicted, which I did.

345
00:15:54.016 --> 00:15:56.899
Hey, Rick, I was thinking maybe we could, like, raid a temple

346
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.839
and go on an epic adventure later today, you know, like...

347
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.099
Morty, get out of my head. I know just the temple.

348
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.339
And we'll grab a couple of hover chairs on the way there.

349
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.799
Impressive.

350
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.439
But what does it even matter

351
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.119
if I'm random or planned?

352
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.907
My heists will still rule.

353
00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:13.659
Well, if the brain inside of you is actually Heistotron's,

354
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.799
it matters, because it explodes

355
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.779
when it hits six levels of contrivance.

356
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.789
Which is exactly why even before...

357
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.047
Initiate clap sequence.

358
00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:27.739
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

359
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.758
Adjusting clap rate.

360
00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:32.209
Clap, clap. Clap. Clap.

361
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.679
Clap. Slow clap achieved.

362
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.699
Clap. Well-done, Rick.

363
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.719
Randotron?

364
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.259
I'm afraid not.

365
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.159
Should be able to walk through Heistotron's lazily contrived...

366
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.039
Not only did you just kill your only ally,

367
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.439
what you thought was a random non-plan

368
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.839
to get to me has been a meticulously choreographed way

369
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.201
of bringing you all in.

370
00:16:55.202 --> 00:16:58.839
Welcome to Heistotron's 975 trillion,

371
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.579
- 467 billion... - That's impressive.

372
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.640
Did you bring us in so that everybody would be here

373
00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.628
when I reveal that you're gonna explode after nine reveals?

374
00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:07.506
By the way, you might not want to answer that.

375
00:17:07.507 --> 00:17:10.139
If you're talking about the code adjustments you made

376
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.419
after I reprogrammed your brain with my nanobots...

377
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.346
I'm immune to your nanobots.

378
00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:17.641
You're immune to the ones you designed, not mine.

379
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.389
I programmed you to build nanobots

380
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.599
that were ineffective on me.

381
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.199
A belief that needed to be placed

382
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.599
in your head by my nanobots.

383
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.699
You believe that because I programmed you to.

384
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.299
That's what I'm saying to you, though.

385
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.519
You believe what I programmed you to believe.

386
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.445
Yes, because I programmed you to believe that.

387
00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:33.090
I programmed you to believe that.

388
00:17:33.115 --> 00:17:34.220
I programmed you to believe that.

389
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.500
I programmed you to believe that.

390
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.059
I programmed you to believe that.

391
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.949
What's happening, Professor Poopybutthole?

392
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.449
He's learning!

393
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.460
I programmed you to believe that.

394
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.040
- I programmed you to believe that. - I programmed you...

395
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:44.499
_

396
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.669
That was my plan the whole time.

397
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.044
That's what I wanted you to think.

398
00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:48.059
I knew you would say that.

399
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.460
I programmed you to believe that.

400
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.717
You think that's true because I wanted you to think that.

401
00:17:51.718 --> 00:17:55.470
And I programmed you to believe that.

402
00:17:56.638 --> 00:17:59.249
A most curious algorithm.

403
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.319
It appears the only perfect heist

404
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.299
is one that was never written.

405
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.040
Goodbye.

406
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.189
Oh, oh, oh, no.

407
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.979
Shit! Alright. Let's get the [BLEEP] out of here!

408
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.419
- Hurry! Go, go! - Rick, I think this was

409
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.079
a powerful lesson in the dangers of AI,

410
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.599
which, by the way, means "love" in Chinese.

411
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.819
Get the [BLEEP] out of here, Elon!

412
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.049
The place is collapsing!

413
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.809
Oh, [BLEEP] Rick! Rick, what time is it?

414
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.449
It's almost 3:00. Why? What's wrong?

415
00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.479
Oh, man, I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this, Rick.

416
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.260
I just... Well, you know that screenplay that I've been writing?

417
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.739
Netflix is pretty interested,

418
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.079
and I've actually got a pitch meeting there today at 3:30.

419
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.679
Oh, buddy. Oh, that's amazing.

420
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.789
Yeah, well, I know you're gonna say

421
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.999
that they're interested in anything,

422
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.639
but, you know, it's a big deal to me, and I've...

423
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.843
No, no, no! Morty, Morty, Morty, I'm so excited for you.

424
00:18:35.844 --> 00:18:36.874
Are you kidding me? Listen,

425
00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.139
don't waste any time explaining.

426
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.569
Let's go. We can put the Earth back later.

427
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.699
- Alright? - Are you sure?

428
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.727
Priorities, Morty. Let's get you to that Netflix meeting.

429
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.499
Crazy day, huh?

430
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.563
Whole sky turned out to be a big circuit board.

431
00:18:48.564 --> 00:18:50.419
Yeah, that's actually part of a-a-a...

432
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.819
an adventure I was having.

433
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.459
Very cool. Traffic okay?

434
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.499
- You have trouble getting here? - No, it was alright.

435
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.759
The planet's still contained

436
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.159
in this sort of big storage grid machine,

437
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.029
so we were sort of already pretty... pretty close by.

438
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.099
Must be nice. Try getting here from Malibu.

439
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.499
So good! Alright. Well, l-let's hear about this heist movie.

440
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.899
Okay, so, it's kind of all...

441
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.969
all built around this big crew with, like, a cool double-cross

442
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.039
and then this big awesome twist where there's, like,

443
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.239
another double cross, but then, um, but...

444
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.359
but then we reveal those things

445
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.760
were all part of the hero's plan, y-you know?

446
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.439
And there's this other crew they put together,

447
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.139
and their plan is to sort of not have a plan,

448
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.260
but... but that was part of the other guy's plan, and...

449
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.859
Kid, if you're slowing down 'cause you think

450
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.739
you're doing bad right now, Jesus Christ.

451
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.119
- That's a really good pitch. - Loving it.

452
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.399
Man, you know, I...

453
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.940
I'm starting to think heists are just really dumb now, you know?

454
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.319
I can't put my finger on why,

455
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.409
but I'd really like to go.

456
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.449
Are you sure?

457
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.119
Yeah, yeah, no, I-I'm sure.

458
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.479
Man, it's as if someone stole his enthusiasm for his own idea.

459
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.799
Yeah, without him even knowing about it.

460
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.465
Without him even knowing about it.

461
00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.344
[BLEEP] Morty's still working on

462
00:19:59.345 --> 00:20:00.889
- that stupid heist script. - _

463
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.119
He's up in his room with his [BLEEP] thumb up his ass.

464
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.559
Skipped out on the last three adventures.

465
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.559
I don't know. Five of my friends got Netflix deals.

466
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.479
- What? - It's a very achievable goal.

467
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.479
- You could lose him. - I'm not gonna [BLEEP] lose him.

468
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.840
[BLEEP] that. I-I'm gonna nip this shit in the bud.

469
00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.192
No. As a matter of fact, you're not nipping anything in the bud.

470
00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:17.569
If Morty ever gives up on a single dream,

471
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.948
it had better be because of his own disillusionment.

472
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.249
Hey, buddy. How'd it go?

473
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.619
I-I don't want to talk about it.

474
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.919
Morty, you know, pal, you, uh...

475
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.959
you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

476
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.499
Yeah, I guess.

477
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.779
Thanks for staying positive about my prospects, Rick.

478
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.919
Of course! You know, you...

479
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.579
I got to help my grandson follow his dreams.

480
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.959
Eh, who needs dreams?

481
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.659
I'll just hang out with you and go on adventures

482
00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.519
and do whatever you want to do, you know, forever.

483
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.199
Oh, well, uh, okay.

484
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.509
I mean, if that's what you want.

485
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.509
Oooo weee! Big storm coming.

486
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.040
- Could be a twister. - Mm-hmm!

487
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.779
Hey, Rick?

488
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.049
Can you walk me through something?

489
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.319
Yeah. What are you thinking?

490
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.119
So, you and Morty knew you needed my help,

491
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.119
but you weren't sure I was good enough at karate,

492
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.539
so you hired my grad students to attack me?

493
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.019
Yep.

494
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.359
But it was an emergency, Rick.

495
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.139
How long did that take?

496
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.680
It actually took less training than you'd think.

497
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.219
Your students all shared

498
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.539
a pretty keen aptitude for martial arts.

499
00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.979
I don't know if that's by coincidence

500
00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.809
or if there's some correlation with their passion

501
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.979
for African-American Women's Studies.

502
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.549
Maya Angelou did personify both acquiescence and perseverance.

503
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.060
Ooo wee. That's exactly the kind of connection

504
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.779
I'd have loved to explore in my class.

505
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.479
Too bad I lost my job

506
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.399
for putting my students in the hospital.

507
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.579
Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.279
Sorry about that.

509
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.400
Mm-hmm.
