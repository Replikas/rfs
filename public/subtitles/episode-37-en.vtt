1
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.209
Tickets, please.

2
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.059
Barkeep. A drink for my colleague.

3
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.077
Do I know you?

4
00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:22.199
I know the only reason to travel by train

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.499
is to travel with weapons.

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.234
And we all know that at the end of this line,

7
00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:27.779
there's only one creature worth killing.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.679
The man in the white coat.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.419
May as well take turns exchanging stories.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.239
Mine begins on planet Ramamama.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.400
Lower him into acid.

12
00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:43.367
Once he's dissolved, lower someone else into acid.

13
00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:45.367
Is he dissolved?

14
00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:48.132
At least use the downtime to reset the acid lowerer.

15
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.460
I really don't like the attitude around here.

16
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.947
It's a very "lower me into acid" attitude.

17
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.099
Who are you?

18
00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:58.642
How did you reach my sanctum?

19
00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:01.119
All right, this is going in circles.

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.260
Seize him!

21
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.858
- Aah! - Aah!

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.368
- Aah! - Aah!

23
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.429
Very well.

24
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.002
Now I will fight you.

25
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.859
Anyway, he tells a different version of the story

26
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.579
where I start crying or something.

27
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.819
That's why he has to die.

28
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.239
'Cause he's a liar.

29
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.340
So...

30
00:01:33.348 --> 00:01:35.459
why are you going to kill Rick Sanchez?

31
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.859
Okay, I don't know who that is.

32
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.599
I don't accept your weird leap in logic

33
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.779
that has everyone on a train going to kill one guy.

34
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.969
And even if I did,

35
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.439
why would we take turns telling stories

36
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.948
about it like little girls at a sleepover?

37
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.640
If you're trying to be hurtful,

38
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.199
you're doing a good job.

39
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.367
I'll take his turn.

40
00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:51.339
Here's why I'm going to kill Rick Sanchez.

41
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.139
- You guys have fun with this. - Dissolve to a clam-shaped sun

42
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.909
rising over a giant beach.

43
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.340
Whew.

44
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.239
By then, of course, he had left toys

45
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.439
and flesh drops for every one of us in the spore-hive.

46
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.409
Ah, a newcomer! I suppose you think

47
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.599
you have a better story

48
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.422
about how Rick Sanchez saved Space Christmas.

49
00:02:08.423 --> 00:02:12.157
What is with the Rick Sanchez obsession?

50
00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:13.957
I think the best way to answer that

51
00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.013
is with my Christmas Rick Tale.

52
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.027
Whoo!

53
00:02:19.028 --> 00:02:20.794
Could've used Rudolph tonight!

54
00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:22.640
Oh, thank God. I'm not too late.

55
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.948
I don't know how to thank you, Goomby.

56
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.579
No need. You just go in there and have a nice time.

57
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.070
I will. Thanks.

58
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.904
Hey.

59
00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:34.447
Merry Christmas, Goomby.

60
00:02:34.448 --> 00:02:35.949
Merry Christmas, Rick.

61
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.609
Oh. Uh...

62
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.679
Oh, it's okay.

63
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.370
I-I don't have to. Sorry if that was...

64
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.788
No. Um, um, I can ask.

65
00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:42.956
No, no, no, I don't wanna be a burden.

66
00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:44.527
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, there's just...

67
00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:45.791
there's a lot of people. Family.

68
00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:46.999
- I get it. - You know? You're not mad?

69
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.327
Totally fine. Bye.

70
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.699
That... Okay, none of my business,

71
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.919
but he didn't even save Christmas in that story.

72
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.719
- Oh, how dare you! - That doesn't mean I'm invested.

73
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.877
Tell your Christmas Rick story!

74
00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:04.639
Step the hell back! Back!

75
00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:12.259
You start teeing up a Rick Sanchez vignette,

76
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.468
and you'll be doing it through two holes.

77
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.669
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with this train.

78
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.404
- Do you remember getting on it? - No.

79
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.576
First thing I remember is...

80
00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:21.590
Tickets, please.

81
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.939
So, why did you date Rick Sanchez?

82
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.899
- What? - Oh, you don't have to pretend

83
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.179
you didn't date him. We all did.

84
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.160
We get it. Low point in your life,

85
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.174
rebound from an ex, et cetera.

86
00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:35.425
No, really, who?

87
00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:37.737
Oh, exactly.

88
00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:42.015
In fact, and get this, when he met my family...

89
00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.317
Aah!

90
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.810
Leah! Leah, check it out.

91
00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:48.539
Where'd you meet this, um...

92
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.640
... sprite?

93
00:03:49.648 --> 00:03:52.157
He's actually a human.

94
00:03:52.158 --> 00:03:54.799
But he invented portal tech?

95
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.404
I am the concept of time.

96
00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:57.614
Jesus!

97
00:03:57.615 --> 00:03:58.657
I warned you not to do that.

98
00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:00.399
- I wasn't trying. - You don't have to.

99
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.859
The train is obviously amplifying

100
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.649
and linking unrelated narrative fields.

101
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.659
Uh-huh...

102
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.219
Morty? I told you if you found me again,

103
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.404
identify yourself.

104
00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:10.040
I didn't know it was you.

105
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.437
How did you not recognize me?

106
00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:12.879
Didn't you create the disguises?

107
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.777
When I create shit, it works, Morty.

108
00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:15.977
It's called being talented.

109
00:04:15.978 --> 00:04:17.217
Why can't we find the engine?

110
00:04:17.218 --> 00:04:19.414
It's not a real train, it's a story device.

111
00:04:19.415 --> 00:04:21.779
Literally. A literal literary device

112
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.087
quite literally metaphorically containing us.

113
00:04:24.088 --> 00:04:26.518
- A simulation. - Worse. An anthology.

114
00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.186
Okay, so how... how do we hijack it?

115
00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:29.689
Oh, Morty, it's been hijacked

116
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.819
for at least two full minutes.

117
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.179
Are you not hearing this insane conversation?

118
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.867
Okay, Tickets Please Guy, stop the anthology.

119
00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:37.967
If we wanted one-offs, we'd do Interdimensional Cable,

120
00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:39.823
not some uptight, overwritten...

121
00:04:39.824 --> 00:04:41.366
- Rick? - God damn!

122
00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:42.837
Tickets, please.

123
00:04:42.838 --> 00:04:45.870
Dude, I'm sure you've got, like, so many tickets at this point.

124
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:48.307
Jesus! The Tickets Please guy is cut!

125
00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:50.017
He... he... he's... he's got those things.

126
00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:52.109
W-what do you call them. Uhm, [BLEEP] gutters.

127
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.579
- Morty, gross! - That's what people call them.

128
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.217
Gross people. I don't want to have to picture

129
00:04:55.218 --> 00:04:57.340
[BLEEP] so watery in such volumes that...

130
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:59.059
Hey, hey, hey, stay back. I'll kick you.

131
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.799
I-I'll kick your shin, bro.

132
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.919
- Aaah! - Hey!

133
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.540
I'll [BLEEP] cook and eat your ticket-taking [BLEEP]

134
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.589
Hey, I found a ticket.

135
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.467
Wow, you are just... ladies and gentlemen,

136
00:05:10.468 --> 00:05:12.397
the Jackie Chan of human shielding.

137
00:05:12.398 --> 00:05:14.019
Who takes the time to get this good at...

138
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.029
[BLEEP] this.

139
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.439
- Aaah. - Structural breach.

140
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.611
Losing continuity.

141
00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:18.819
Morty, hold on to something.

142
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.729
Keep your head inside.

143
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.180
Aaah!

144
00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:26.369
_

145
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.729
Share with your sister, Josh.

146
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.799
Just because it's your birthday

147
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.899
doesn't mean you can be an asshole.

148
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.717
- You okay, Dad? - Is this real?

149
00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:34.056
I doubt it, but you get what you get

150
00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:35.239
when you eat dinner in an arcade.

151
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.422
I mean are you real, is life real?

152
00:05:37.423 --> 00:05:38.620
Okay, I'm calling the nurse

153
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.799
because you are not doing this tonight.

154
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.809
You're God damn right

155
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.027
- I'm not because... - You are not doing this tonight!

156
00:05:43.028 --> 00:05:44.387
This isn't real life!

157
00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:45.767
- Dad? Oh, my God! - Honey. Sweetie.

158
00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:47.039
- What's happening? - Give me your tickets.

159
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.219
I... I need tickets.

160
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.579
Everyone give me tickeeeeeettttttts!

161
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.605
Aaaah!

162
00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:55.399
Aaah!

163
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.111
Emergency continuity deployed.

164
00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:05.957
- This could come in handy. - Can't we just ride out the...

165
00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.744
[BLEEP] you, I'd rather die.

166
00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:09.127
Train cops! Hands in the air!

167
00:06:09.128 --> 00:06:10.455
Tee up a story about Rick Sanchez!

168
00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:12.024
- He is Rick! - Jesus Christ!

169
00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:13.379
Is that the Tickets Please Guy?

170
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.749
Well, just the stub.

171
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.059
- Too soon! - Too soon!

172
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.922
Don't move! Too soon!

173
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.050
So, what did the Train Cops do wrong?

174
00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:24.052
Shot... people?

175
00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:25.425
- Shot passengers. - Wrong.

176
00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.859
The passengers tampered with the anthology's structure.

177
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.247
Lethal response was permitted,

178
00:06:29.248 --> 00:06:31.577
but not with him holding that tank.

179
00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:33.311
Let's take a look at what they should have done.

180
00:06:33.312 --> 00:06:34.521
Train cops! Hands in the air!

181
00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.760
- Drop the tank! Drop it! - Drop it! Drop the tank.

182
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.119
Sorry to nitpick, sir,

183
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.379
but if there was a continuity explosion,

184
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.760
isn't there always one?

185
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.783
And doesn't that mean those two could be anywhere?

186
00:06:46.784 --> 00:06:48.727
What? No, you idiot, that... it's...

187
00:06:48.728 --> 00:06:50.871
It's just a training video. That didn't actually happen.

188
00:06:50.872 --> 00:06:53.119
- That's what you think. - Hey. How'd you get here?

189
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.099
Yeah, like we're the ones that popped up out of nowhere?

190
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.140
[BLEEP] these guys.

191
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.714
Hey, what the hell? Your leg is healed.

192
00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:03.119
Yeah, it's a real free-for-all.

193
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.129
Here we go.

194
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.052
Of course this thing is just a [BLEEP] circle.

195
00:07:06.053 --> 00:07:08.139
You'd think it was so God damn complicated...

196
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.589
Okay, here's where the stupid vignettes were.

197
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.308
God, imagine if that had been the whole thing.

198
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:16.062
So now we're here, and the engine must be here.

199
00:07:16.063 --> 00:07:17.857
I'll have to rig us a couple of space suits

200
00:07:17.858 --> 00:07:19.631
that start failing around here

201
00:07:19.632 --> 00:07:21.219
so we can pay a heavy price

202
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.867
for re-entering at this threshold.

203
00:07:22.868 --> 00:07:24.327
We have to leave the train?

204
00:07:24.328 --> 00:07:25.964
We don't have to do anything, Morty.

205
00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:27.479
This is just a structural guide.

206
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.540
We're obviously gonna impart our own style.

207
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.137
I don't like how meta this is getting, Rick.

208
00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:32.367
Shut up, Morty. You're 14.

209
00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:33.877
You watch videos of people on YouTube

210
00:07:33.878 --> 00:07:35.537
reacting to [BLEEP] YouTube.

211
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:36.916
I'll be the judge of when we get too meta.

212
00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:37.947
Holy [BLEEP]

213
00:07:37.948 --> 00:07:39.208
- How is he still breathing? - Aah!

214
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.539
He's suspended in disbelief, slowly dying

215
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.977
while living out an alternative non-diagetic reality.

216
00:07:43.978 --> 00:07:45.979
Geez, what a horrible way to die.

217
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.989
You don't know the half of it.

218
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.479
Oh!

219
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.526
You're on fuego with the guy-torn-in-half bits, Rick.

220
00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:51.579
That one was organic, though.

221
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.240
That's because you're naturally funny.

222
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.419
That... that's good old-fashioned fun right there, you know?

223
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.019
W-w-we don't need to over-think [BLEEP], okay?

224
00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.819
Okay, buddy. Nice and grounded,

225
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.895
fully immersive from here on out.

226
00:08:00.896 --> 00:08:03.219
- Right after this. - W-what's happening?

227
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.600
Going into an act break.

228
00:08:05.612 --> 00:08:07.609
âª Not quite a bird âª

229
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.799
âª Not quite a person âª

230
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.125
âª Maybe what matters âª

231
00:08:11.126 --> 00:08:13.627
âª Is to love yourself first and âª

232
00:08:13.628 --> 00:08:15.379
âª Soar âª

233
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.359
âª Child of air and land âª

234
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.490
âª With wings and hands âª

235
00:08:19.496 --> 00:08:21.427
âª Yes, you're a bird and a person âª

236
00:08:21.428 --> 00:08:23.637
âª I'm a bird and a person âª

237
00:08:23.638 --> 00:08:25.539
âª And more âª

238
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.219
Sure, that was a great moment,

239
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.699
but it was hardly the best time

240
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.139
Rick and Morty were musical.

241
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.499
- Who can forget the t... - Hey.

242
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.669
You guys think there's something weird

243
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.799
about this train?

244
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.879
We've been here a really long time

245
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.119
and nobody's taken our tickets.

246
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.935
Aaah!

247
00:08:39.063 --> 00:08:40.897
Aaaah!

248
00:08:40.898 --> 00:08:43.187
The galaxy's greatest scientists continue to ponder

249
00:08:43.188 --> 00:08:45.987
the horrific figure known to children as Floaty Blood Man.

250
00:08:45.988 --> 00:08:48.571
But after three months, nobody is any closer to the truth.

251
00:08:48.572 --> 00:08:50.654
For Cutesy Name News, I'm Uncle Nibbles.

252
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:53.139
I can't believe Floaty Bloody Man is real.

253
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.127
He's more than real, he's my new god.

254
00:08:55.128 --> 00:08:57.079
- Check it. - Is that brand-new,

255
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.260
- or is the blood just... - Accurately depicted, yeah.

256
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.159
His followers believe the entire universe

257
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.169
is Floaty Bloody Man's nightmare as he dies

258
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.760
in a time-dilated reality.

259
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.672
- So we could go at any minute. - No.

260
00:09:06.673 --> 00:09:08.799
I'm part of the Floaty Nogasm Brotherhood.

261
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.159
We believe we're keeping him alive

262
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.470
by redirecting our suppressed sexual energies.

263
00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:14.017
You're staying a virgin

264
00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:16.587
just to keep the universe existing?

265
00:09:16.588 --> 00:09:20.179
- That's... so attractive. - It is?

266
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.019
Okay, look, let's just do it once.

267
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.900
Sorry.

268
00:09:28.695 --> 00:09:30.609
Aaah!

269
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.460
- Happy now? - He was suffering.

270
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.219
Keep moving. We have to get to the return threshold

271
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.499
before the ticking clock on your suit gets to zero.

272
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.607
Why would you put ticking clock...

273
00:09:37.608 --> 00:09:38.769
Because if it's too easy to get there,

274
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.779
we'll never get there.

275
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.041
If you don't want to be meta stop, deconstructing shit.

276
00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:43.960
That's the thematic seal.

277
00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:45.718
Gotta find a way to disrupt it.

278
00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:48.859
Okay, Morty, tell a story unrelated to us.

279
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.967
- Uh, what do... - Stop thinking and do it!

280
00:09:50.968 --> 00:09:52.883
Uh, okay, uh, there was this...

281
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.460
My name is Mike Johnson. That's good coffee.

282
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.557
Better get that door.

283
00:09:57.558 --> 00:09:59.519
Iiiiiiii, hello.

284
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.799
I want your cookies.

285
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.395
I'm hungry, I want your cookies.

286
00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:03.859
Scorpions, scorpions.

287
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.810
There's scorpions outside. Get inside.

288
00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:07.150
What do they want from us?

289
00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:08.249
They want food.

290
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.986
- Me too. - Okay, just stop.

291
00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:11.637
I'm not a writer, okay?

292
00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:13.649
Relax, your story was supposed to be awful and stupid.

293
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.948
I just failed to predict how well

294
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.247
that would mesh with the theme.

295
00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:17.629
Think. Think.

296
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.147
What kind of story would we never...

297
00:10:19.148 --> 00:10:21.329
Morty, do you know what the Bechdel Test is?

298
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.717
- The what? - For God's sake, Morty,

299
00:10:22.718 --> 00:10:24.519
the formula for measuring female agency

300
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.579
in a story proposed by lesbian cartoonist Allison...

301
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.379
what the hell are they teaching you in that school?!

302
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.179
- Other stuff! - Then you've killed us both!

303
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.199
Why is lesbian part of her job title?!

304
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.549
Oh, now you're progressive?!

305
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.499
- What is the test?! - You have to tell...

306
00:10:38.468 --> 00:10:40.637
Morty, Morty.

307
00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:43.167
Two women. They both have to have names

308
00:10:43.168 --> 00:10:45.144
and talk to each other about something...

309
00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.719
- Rick! - ... other than a man...

310
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.065
Oh, Rick, listen to me.

311
00:10:48.066 --> 00:10:49.419
Once upon a time,

312
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.612
my mom and my sister... Listen to me!

313
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.839
Mom, can I try your tea?

314
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.579
Yes, Summer.

315
00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.299
Yes. Try my tea.

316
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.621
It's so good. It's so warm.

317
00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:03.769
Mom, can I talk to you

318
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.291
about my special time?

319
00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:07.409
It's okay. I have one, too.

320
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.799
Mine is heavy today.

321
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.467
Mine is never light.

322
00:11:10.468 --> 00:11:12.337
I love you ever since you were...

323
00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.637
mailed to me.

324
00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:15.259
By a doctor woman.

325
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.179
Your special time is your power.

326
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.055
It makes you strong like a boob.

327
00:11:19.056 --> 00:11:20.264
Strong against what?

328
00:11:20.265 --> 00:11:22.439
Scorpions. Female Scorpions.

329
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.269
They're attacking outside. Come on.

330
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.769
Fight them with your heavy special time.

331
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.809
You do it, too.

332
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.789
- Hello? - Hello?

333
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.959
I'm that Supreme Court lady, and you [BLEEP] did it.

334
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.490
- We did it! - We did it!

335
00:11:48.418 --> 00:11:50.407
Great job, Morty.

336
00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:52.798
A feminist masterpiece. Hey, look.

337
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.677
Guess who's got two penises and all the agency?

338
00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.679
Rick and Morty.

339
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.859
Story Lord.

340
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.139
I should've known you were behind this, and I did.

341
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.479
- Who is this guy? - Ugh.

342
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.357
He's like a Matrix Space Frasier.

343
00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:09.759
Let's get this fight over with, nerd.

344
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.769
I've got [BLEEP] to do.

345
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.279
You of all people know, Rick,

346
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.902
there can be no destination without a journey.

347
00:12:14.903 --> 00:12:16.946
I don't know that at all. I regularly teleport.

348
00:12:16.947 --> 00:12:19.697
Oh, of course. No rules for you.

349
00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:21.397
Spiraling through the multiverse,

350
00:12:21.398 --> 00:12:24.379
burping semi-improvised dialogue about how nothing matters,

351
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.870
so we may as well pull out our [BLEEP] and rub them

352
00:12:26.878 --> 00:12:29.544
on fate's glaring teeth like we're brushing fate's teeth,

353
00:12:29.545 --> 00:12:31.959
but we're using your gross, dirty [BLEEP]

354
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.045
Must be nice.

355
00:12:33.046 --> 00:12:34.130
Nobody's stopping you.

356
00:12:34.131 --> 00:12:36.299
True. Not anymore.

357
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:38.884
- Goddamn! - We already did this.

358
00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:41.057
Oh, is this a double beat? Oh, well.

359
00:12:41.058 --> 00:12:43.014
Just how I adventure, dawg.

360
00:12:43.015 --> 00:12:44.029
This is more impressive

361
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.387
than the Tickets Please Guy, though.

362
00:12:45.388 --> 00:12:47.144
You are like 90% [BLEEP] gutter.

363
00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:49.780
It's called discipline. Watch this.

364
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.379
- God damn. - Geez!

365
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.479
- Do we have to fight him? - I don't want to.

366
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.799
We surrender. We're not fighting.

367
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.068
Ow!

368
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:58.099
Ow!

369
00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.720
[BLEEP] kick your ass.

370
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.073
Ow!

371
00:13:01.074 --> 00:13:02.325
Oh!

372
00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:04.411
Hey! Get back in your egg!

373
00:13:06.455 --> 00:13:07.519
- What the... - Don't worry, Morty!

374
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.600
Nothing out there is canon!

375
00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:11.459
- We've got a pulse. - Stay with me, Private.

376
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.210
Smith, listen to me. You were exposed

377
00:13:13.218 --> 00:13:15.546
to a chemical that is altering your mind.

378
00:13:15.547 --> 00:13:16.557
To beat it, you have to hold on...

379
00:13:16.558 --> 00:13:19.287
- We're losing him. - Aliens. Sarge?!

380
00:13:19.288 --> 00:13:21.762
Morty, never forget the highest truth of all...

381
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.439
you're getting your ass kicked on a train.

382
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.259
Professor Sanchez?

383
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.359
Did it work?

384
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.769
I wouldn't say that, Marcus.

385
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.021
I'd say it [BLEEP] worked.

386
00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:34.637
100% time dilation and total immersion.

387
00:13:34.638 --> 00:13:35.729
Define "total."

388
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.799
Marcus, I've been back in reality for three hours,

389
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.147
and I still have memories of a completely different life.

390
00:13:40.148 --> 00:13:42.069
I-I-I was a scientist still.

391
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.917
I-I-I was... I-I-I had developed

392
00:13:43.918 --> 00:13:46.984
inter-dimensional travel, I-I-I-I had a daughter.

393
00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:48.499
I-I didn't have a mustache.

394
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.331
I-I was kinda funny sometimes,

395
00:13:51.332 --> 00:13:52.660
mostly burping.

396
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.287
No more secret testing.

397
00:13:54.288 --> 00:13:55.544
I can help people now.

398
00:13:55.545 --> 00:13:56.928
You've helped people.

399
00:13:56.929 --> 00:13:58.080
I've hurt more.

400
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.599
- Aaah! - P-P-Professor Sanchez.

401
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.093
I-I'm Morty Smith from the... the... the the 241st.

402
00:14:03.094 --> 00:14:04.879
They... they... put your pill in our food.

403
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.499
- It... it works. - Call the police!

404
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.319
It's okay. It's okay. It's not real.

405
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.890
N-n-n-n-nothing's real.

406
00:14:09.893 --> 00:14:12.561
- I'm sorry, son. - I-i-it's okay. You aren't real.

407
00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:17.275
God, you're right. I should do more freeform stuff.

408
00:14:17.276 --> 00:14:18.940
In you go.

409
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.319
- What's happening? - The reason I brought you here.

410
00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.839
I'll now fuel my anthology

411
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.139
with your limitless potential,

412
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.340
propelling it to its final stop...

413
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.953
beyond the fifth wall.

414
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.979
You idiot. Our potential isn't limitless.

415
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.299
You'll never break the fifth wall before you've burnt us out.

416
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.039
Is that so? Oh, well. Win-win.

417
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.599
Rick, w-what's he doing?

418
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.240
He's trying to tap into us, Morty. Resist.

419
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.019
I can't believe you're finally headed off to college.

420
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.959
Yeah, you know, it really felt like you were gonna be 17 forever.

421
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.849
For, like, 16 years, at least.

422
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.199
I can't believe I'm tearing up over this.

423
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.699
Jesus, Rick, you know, you've really softened up.

424
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.040
It's a human moment, Morty.

425
00:14:56.048 --> 00:14:57.606
It's a human moment.

426
00:14:57.607 --> 00:14:59.317
- Aaah! - Aaah! It hurts!

427
00:15:05.728 --> 00:15:07.867
Abradolph Lincoler? I thought you were dead.

428
00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:10.769
I'm very much alive, and I need your help.

429
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:11.779
Yeah!

430
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.839
[BLEEP] He's taking the good stuff, Morty.

431
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.439
Wait, is... is any of this canon?

432
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.459
It could have been.

433
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.760
Oh, dear.

434
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.547
Are there things Rick Sanchez holds sacred after all?

435
00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:29.014
How did you find us?

436
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.599
I trusted you!

437
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.339
Don't blame others for your bad decisions.

438
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.019
Resist, Morty!

439
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.619
Resist before he burns us out!

440
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.320
Oh, too late now!

441
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.497
What's wrong, Rick?

442
00:15:41.498 --> 00:15:43.944
Don't you want to see how your story ends?!

443
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.019
Holy [BLEEP], Rick. What do we...

444
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.389
There... there... there's now way out!

445
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.399
You're right, Morty.

446
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.544
Sometimes it does seem like there's no way out.

447
00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:04.591
Like it's hopeless.

448
00:16:04.592 --> 00:16:07.174
But remember, there's always someone there for us.

449
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:08.599
- Who? - My best friend

450
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.763
and personal savior, Jesus Christ.

451
00:16:10.764 --> 00:16:12.598
What?! You... you don't believe in God.

452
00:16:12.599 --> 00:16:13.997
But He believes in us, Morty.

453
00:16:13.998 --> 00:16:15.824
You know, I thought I was the inventor,

454
00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:17.199
but the greatest invention of all

455
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.667
is the free gift of Eternal Life.

456
00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:20.439
Is this... are you [BLEEP] with me?

457
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.608
Oh, trust me, Morty.

458
00:16:21.609 --> 00:16:24.167
I've done plenty of effed up stuff in my life.

459
00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:26.407
But it's never too late to accept Christ.

460
00:16:26.408 --> 00:16:28.169
Jesus is always knocking at the door.

461
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.248
All we have to do is open it

462
00:16:29.249 --> 00:16:30.877
- and let Him into our hearts. - How?

463
00:16:30.878 --> 00:16:32.269
I'm so glad you asked, Morty.

464
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.499
Just close your eyes and go to Him in prayer.

465
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.509
Like this.

466
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.919
- Heavenly Father. - Heavenly Father.

467
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.819
Thank you for sending your only begotten son.

468
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.239
What a second, no! What are you doing?!

469
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.427
Jesus, I accept you into my heart.

470
00:16:43.428 --> 00:16:44.827
No! This sucks.

471
00:16:44.828 --> 00:16:46.549
Stop! You guys would never do this.

472
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.097
Fill me with your Spirit.

473
00:16:48.098 --> 00:16:49.427
Make me a shining city on a hill for you.

474
00:16:49.428 --> 00:16:51.639
- No! No! - Make me born again.

475
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.309
- No! - In Jesus's name, we pray.

476
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.319
- Amen. - Amen.

477
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.337
- Amen! - You did it!

478
00:16:56.338 --> 00:16:57.767
- Way to go, Morty! - Crossy.

479
00:16:57.768 --> 00:16:59.037
Bible-Saurus. You made it.

480
00:16:59.038 --> 00:17:01.063
We wouldn't miss this for anything!

481
00:17:01.064 --> 00:17:02.395
You said it, Mr. Celery.

482
00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:04.377
What the [BLEEP] is all of this?!

483
00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:06.217
Greatest story ever told, Story Lord.

484
00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:08.077
No, it's not. It's awful!

485
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.080
I beg your pardon?

486
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.069
Ah!

487
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.359
Goddamn.

488
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.119
My Lord and my God!

489
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.372
- No! No! It sucks in here. - Let's get the [BLEEP] outta here.

490
00:17:18.373 --> 00:17:20.227
Go, now.

491
00:17:20.228 --> 00:17:21.727
Ugh. We're safe, Morty.

492
00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:23.397
Nobody ever wanted to see that shit.

493
00:17:23.398 --> 00:17:25.197
Wh-what's gonna happen to Story Lord?

494
00:17:25.198 --> 00:17:27.537
He gets to spend eternity in every writer's hell...

495
00:17:27.538 --> 00:17:28.799
- the Bible. - I don't know.

496
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.659
Some people actually like that stuff.

497
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.940
Seems kind of cynical.

498
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.907
I just don't like taking cheap shots, you know?

499
00:17:33.908 --> 00:17:35.707
Cheap shots? Morty, we were literally

500
00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:37.104
saved by Jesus Christ.

501
00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:38.940
Tell me in any way how that's offensive.

502
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.099
This was a little confusing,

503
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.647
but I guess it brought us closer together, you know?

504
00:17:42.648 --> 00:17:44.147
Tested our demons.

505
00:17:44.148 --> 00:17:45.799
Made us believe in ourselves more than ever.

506
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.040
Yeah. You're right, Morty.

507
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.914
We got all that meta-canon shit outta the way

508
00:17:48.915 --> 00:17:50.540
and now we can just be ourselves.

509
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.320
Now what do you say we bring this train into the station.

510
00:18:03.438 --> 00:18:05.878
Oh [BLEEP].

511
00:18:05.879 --> 00:18:07.463
So what do you think?

512
00:18:07.464 --> 00:18:09.004
Wow. Where did you get this thing?

513
00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.540
The Citadel of Ricks Gift Shop.

514
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.859
Do you really like it?

515
00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.347
I didn't think you'd even care.

516
00:18:13.348 --> 00:18:15.577
What? Morty. No. I love it.

517
00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:17.284
You did the most important thing.

518
00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:18.579
You... you bought something.

519
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.117
- What? - You bought something.

520
00:18:20.118 --> 00:18:22.817
With money. God. I love money so much, Morty.

521
00:18:22.818 --> 00:18:24.957
- Are you being sarcastic? - Merchandise, Morty.

522
00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.627
Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise.

523
00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:29.257
And you did it. You went into a store...

524
00:18:29.258 --> 00:18:32.027
an actual honest to God store... and you bought something.

525
00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.027
You didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints.

526
00:18:34.028 --> 00:18:36.139
You... you just looked straight into the bleeding jaws

527
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.460
of capitalism and said "Yes, daddy, please."

528
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.579
And I'm... I'm so proud of you.

529
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.137
I only wish you could've bought more.

530
00:18:42.138 --> 00:18:44.501
I... I love buying things so much, Morty.

531
00:18:44.502 --> 00:18:45.819
Rick, are... are you...

532
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.211
do you need to go to the hospital?

533
00:18:47.212 --> 00:18:49.400
I love you, Morty. Give Grandpa a kiss.

534
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.319
Give... give... gimme... give Grandpa a kiss.

535
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.479
Lips if you want. What...

536
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.489
whatever you're comfortable with.

537
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.511
Some cultures do that.

538
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.310
That was sweet. Thank you.

539
00:18:57.318 --> 00:18:59.788
I... I love you. You're my little buddy.

540
00:18:59.789 --> 00:19:01.260
Okay.

541
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.994
Let's watch some Interdimensional Cable.

542
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.879
So you're saying my father

543
00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.340
and His kingdom...

544
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.299
Well, yes... it's based on the fusion

545
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.079
of a Sumerian god named "Ya"

546
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.409
and a Mesopotamian god named "Way."

547
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.199
And we're in a toy train?

548
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.519
Yes.

549
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.948
It's enough to really make you question

550
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.017
all of existence, isn't it?

551
00:19:26.018 --> 00:19:28.517
So what do you think you're gonna do about it?

552
00:19:28.518 --> 00:19:31.717
I'm gonna do what I've always done.

553
00:19:31.718 --> 00:19:33.757
I'm gonna get the [BLEEP] outta here.

554
00:19:33.758 --> 00:19:38.049
Father of omens! Give me blood beyond sight!

555
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.599
Hey, what the [BLEEP] Morty? The train you got me

556
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.199
just completely derailed itself.

557
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.359
There's blood all over the windows on it.

558
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.819
Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick. I guess I'll return it.

559
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.240
Return... Are you insane?

560
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.419
Did you hear nothing I said?

561
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.639
Buy another one, Morty.

562
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.719
Consume, Morty.

563
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.077
Nobody's out there shopping with this [BLEEP] virus.

564
00:19:55.078 --> 00:19:56.573
Where's your [BLEEP] wallet?!

565
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.568
Tired of the same boring adventures

566
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.760
with your dogshit Morty?

567
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.963
- Yeah! - Aw. Geez.

568
00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:34.151
Then get ready for the Citadel of Rick's Story Train.

569
00:20:34.152 --> 00:20:36.160
Story Train. Story Train.

570
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.348
The Citadel of Rick's Story Train

571
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.364
comes with car after car of enemies, lovers,

572
00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:42.033
and Goomby, all grappling with the nature of who you truly are.

573
00:20:42.034 --> 00:20:43.779
Rick is a god! Tickets Please.

574
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.496
Whoa! Watch out! It's Story Lord!

575
00:20:45.497 --> 00:20:46.623
Damn. He's jacked.

576
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.159
Pure [BLEEP] gutter.

577
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.468
And of course, what story would be complete

578
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.586
without the engineer of the Greatest Story Ever Told.

579
00:20:51.587 --> 00:20:53.769
- Oh, Jesus Christ. - I have come not to judge

580
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.129
the world, but to save it.

581
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.579
And the best part is, the fun never ends.

582
00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.519
Thanks to the Rick-patented anthology generator,

583
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.019
you'll never run out of new stories

584
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.899
- and people to tell them. - Are they alive?

585
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.548
Of course. But not in any ways that matter.

586
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.808
They. Have. No. Souls.

587
00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:07.469
Puppets. Of. Fate.

588
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.679
The Story Train. Available now

589
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.348
in The Citadel of Ricks. Buy it ironically.

590
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.560
Buy it sincerely. Just buy it.

591
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.848
Not buying it is an act of buying it.

592
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.259
Buy it now. Look it up. It's real.

593
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.677
On the Internet. It's there. Buy it. Buy the train.

594
00:21:18.678 --> 00:21:19.838
We want you to buy the train.
