00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.390
Before we move off this topic,

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.684
can I ask if you're currently a hologram?

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.660
Yeah, yeah. Hold on. One sec.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.180
Left a bag of Funyuns down there last week.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.416
Didn't want to waste our time.

6
00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:17.180
Okay. Let's do it. Therapy me.

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.603
- Do you need to take that? - No. Just the president.

8
00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:24.441
Maybe we should turn off the phone.

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.840
President of the United States.

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.949
Thought you might think that was cool.

11
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.950
You like it when people think you're cool?

12
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.305
You're extra-analytical today.

13
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.559
Looking to remodel your kitchen?

14
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.076
Sanchez, I know you're in there.

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190
When I call you directly, it's an emergency.

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.400
I was in therapy. Don't stigmatize mental health.

17
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240
How rude of me. Hello.

18
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.530
- I'm President Andre Curtis. - Yes, I recognize you.

19
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.900
Oh? How nice.

20
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.382
It's not nice to recognize a president. Can we go?

21
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.080
In 1961, the CIA secretly relocated the Loch Ness Monster

22
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.720
to Lake Erie and replaced her bones with titanium.

23
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.860
She was then bit by several werewolves,

24
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.890
giving us the ultimate anti-submarine weapon.

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.940
- Got it. - But the Soviets smuggled in

26
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.520
a leprechaun, who turned Nessie's bones to silver,

27
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.560
giving her the were-version of AIDS.

28
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.920
She sank to the bottom, and we assumed she was dead.

29
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.320
But she was only asleep. Now she's awake and hungry.

30
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.340
- You can't date my shrink. - What?

31
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.260
- Bro, you're nuts. - Then don't date my shrink.

32
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm not dating your shrink.

33
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.480
She probably doesn't even like me.

34
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.550
- Stand down, Sanchez. - Tell him to stand down.

35
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.100
Would you let him bang your therapist?

36
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870
I don't believe in therapy.

37
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.560
What the hell does that even mean, you don't believe in it?

38
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.592
- He's a Scientologist. - Don't date my shrink!

39
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.020
And don't be a space Mormon.

40
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.860
- Why not? - It's silly.

41
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.920
Sorry. It's a cheap shot.

42
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.200
Worship how you want.

43
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.050
- I like Tom Cruise. - Thank you.

44
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.604
- Therapy's working. - Keep it in your pants.

45
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.040
Ooh. Welcome back to Mr. Stabby.

46
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.393
Let's get another question from the audience.

47
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.990
Ow. Augh.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.230
Why do people get tickets to his tapings?

49
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.860
It's a fame-obsessed culture.

50
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.279
- Mr. President? - I got an emergency, Rick.

51
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.740
Another president mission?

52
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.680
You just killed the Loch Ness Monster for him.

53
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.849
Tell that little bitch to zip it.

54
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.270
You can't talk to me like that.

55
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.799
Tell him he can't talk to me like that.

56
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.009
You can't talk to Morty like that.

57
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.620
- Whatever. - I'll portal over.

58
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.240
I've seen this one anyway. The audience dies.

59
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.960
Rick, thanks for coming.

60
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.190
We've got a situation in the state of Virginia.

61
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.740
- Bigfoot? - That's Montana.

62
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.990
- Nazis? - That's, uh... everywhere.

63
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.440
That's an exaggeration, sir.

64
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.020
Jesus, Carl. You, too?

65
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.040
The problem in Virginia is... love.

66
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.460
You've heard the state motto, "Virginia is for Lovers"?

67
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.780
Well, now they've codified it into law.

68
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.858
Virginia has declared itself literally and exclusively for lovers.

69
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.780
- Sounds boring. - It gets worse.

70
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.240
There's no crime, no poverty,

71
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.360
and suspiciously, no complaints.

72
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.491
The governor just hit 100% approval rating.

73
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.860
- And that's worse? - 100%?

74
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.120
Get on the web, Dwayne.

75
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.440
There's no such thing as 100% of anything.

76
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.200
America knows and incinerates a cult when it sees one.

77
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.730
But I can't do that to all of Virginia,

78
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.120
so we need to infiltrate.

79
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.230
I volunteer to do acid to prove I'm not a cop.

80
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.350
No lone wolves. We need a crack team for this one.

81
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.700
Rick, meet Fleeflak.

82
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.304
He might be able to tell the future.

83
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.070
- Might? - We're waiting to find out.

84
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.720
Onyx here is a weapons specialist,

85
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.920
and our eye in the sky is my chief of staff bot, Chi-Chi.

86
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.062
- Sleek. - Yes. An excellent team.

87
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.380
Ah, but there's something missing.

88
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.020
- A psychology expert, perhaps. - Oh, fuck me.

89
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.610
You pretended to need a crack team

90
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.070
so you could get Wong's number?

91
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.320
Get her number? I own the CIA.

92
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.116
If I wanted, I could get her genome.

93
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.830
So, you wanted what from me, permission? You got it.

94
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.930
It's a free country, so you're always saying.

95
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.730
That's certainly all I'd be willing to pay.

96
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.980
You're making me choose? You or her?

97
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.660
There's three billion women on this planet

98
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.640
that have nothing to do with me.

99
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.755
Can you blame them?

100
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.257
- You suck. - Wait! Danger.

101
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.177
Wow. That's great, buddy.

102
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.000
It's going right on the fridge.

103
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.100
I appreciate your lending your expertise to this mission, Dr. Wong.

104
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.690
- Gun? - No, thank you.

105
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.800
I was surprised to receive your call, but excited.

106
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.110
I haven't done field work since grad school.

107
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.460
We think the people of Virginia

108
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.080
have become some kind of hippie sex cult.

109
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.400
I haven't done that since grad school, either.

110
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.800
Ho-ho! Dr. Wong, you are a firecracker.

111
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.370
Sir, we've reached the border.

112
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.832
- Halt! - _

113
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.980
I'm so sorry, Mr. President.

114
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.750
Virginia is closed to visitors.

115
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.220
I thought it was for lovers.

116
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.260
I'm a lover.

117
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.670
- You guys lovers? - Mm-hmm.

118
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.140
I appreciate that,

119
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.590
but the rest of your country

120
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.900
doesn't need Virginia's love right now.

121
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.420
You know, the last time a state talked that way,

122
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.280
we had to have a whole thing.

123
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.580
And?

124
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.521
And this time, the other side has nukes.

125
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.060
Let them in.

126
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.690
Well done, Doctor.

127
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.900
Call me Helen.

128
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.760
As you can see, Virginia has no crime, no poverty.

129
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.373
- All goods are freely given. - Communist bastards.

130
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.180
And all goods are freely made.

131
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.793
Communist bastards.

132
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.820
So, what happened? Tell me the secret.

133
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.360
Well, if I tell you, you'll tell everyone.

134
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.900
But if I show you, you won't have to.

135
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.520
How unsettling and cryptic.

136
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.220
Oh!

137
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.980
My God. So, that's it? You're all just drunk!

138
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.720
Sir, it's some kind of body-snatching hive-mind.

139
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.700
Finally, your religion comes in handy.

140
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.401
No! My only chance at meeting Will Smith.

141
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.730
Pick up your phone, asshole.

142
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.869
When I call, it's an actual emergency.

143
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.330
Rick?

144
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.080
Unity.

145
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.000
Take it easy. Take it easy.

146
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.003
I can explain. Just let me get things under control.

147
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.920
You controlling things is the explanation.

148
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.090
And we agreed you wouldn't do it where I work.

149
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.910
What the fuck are you spraying me with?

150
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.940
A new scent I picked up after you left.

151
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.420
I call it Separation.

152
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.840
You concocted a me repellent?

153
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.186
Does that look like a bad idea?

154
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.820
Rick, are you in a relationship with the population of Virginia?

155
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.150
We dated.

156
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.150
I just want to talk.

157
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.650
I'm pretty sure you have trillions of cellphones.

158
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.492
No. Come back. Let's talk.

159
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.530
Thank God you had a crack team with you.

160
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.041
- Where's Helen? - Helen?

161
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.360
She initiated first name.

162
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.520
Whoa!

163
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.713
Call in a chopper. I'm being cock-blocked.

164
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.180
Rick, it's me.

165
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.910
I was released from Unity.

166
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.840
Cool. So, you won't mind if I spray this.

167
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.010
Well, I won't, but we're surrounded

168
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.970
and Unity knows your reload time.

169
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.130
I really believe you and Unity should talk.

170
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.540
How would you know? You're just a nutritionist.

171
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.359
When you work in nutritionism as long as I have,

172
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.620
you get a certain feel.

173
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.980
Calm down.

174
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.430
We came because we're worried about you.

175
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.860
- Why? - We hear things, Rick.

176
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.457
I tried calling, but is it true you're looking for... him again?

177
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.360
You almost died last time.

178
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.720
That's none of your business.

179
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.130
- You're our business. - You quit that business.

180
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.539
And you're fired from that business.

181
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.960
And I'm using your last paycheque

182
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.360
to cover the stapler you stole, which was my heart.

183
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.980
Civil War, baby.

184
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.976
Sorry. That was supposed to be suppressive.

185
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.980
Aah! Aah! Rick, wait.

186
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.100
Aah!

187
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.460
- Thank you, Andre. - Thank you, Helen.

188
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.570
It's time to put these bastards on ice.

189
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.180
- Cue up the dome. - Yes, sir!

190
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.610
Ow!

191
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.140
Do you have a dome the size of every state?

192
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.660
You'll need a second date for that answer.

193
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.680
Barf.

194
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.659
A nation in turmoil tonight,

195
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.340
as the entire state of Virginia

196
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.359
continues to be trapped inside an energy dome.

197
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.599
The White House released a statement

198
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.180
dismissing the president's shouts of "Civil War, baby," as hyperbole.

199
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.570
Shonda, what do we make of that?

200
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.290
More like "hyper bully," Tom.

201
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.100
Oh, shit. Shonda came to play.

202
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.670
This president has been in office

203
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.540
for how many alien invasions?

204
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.100
Not to mention the mutant turkeys,

205
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.050
the abandoned White House orbiting our planet,

206
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.754
the Eco-conscious dinosaurs.

207
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.960
Then he sees Virginia, with its perfect economy

208
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.320
so he shoots them and puts them in a dome?

209
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.720
- Classic Curtis. - Will someone mute the goddamn news?

210
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.060
If I want a list of my failures, I'd dig up my mother.

211
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.049
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. That's a turn-off, right?

212
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.090
Guy screaming about his mother in a war room?

213
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.440
Sanchez, America hates your dome.

214
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.399
- How long is it going to be up? - Hope you marked that.

215
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.570
It was his dome in the chopper. Now it's mine.

216
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.060
It will contain that part of Unity until I shut it down,

217
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.300
because one of us here knows how to set boundaries.

218
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.540
Rick, I agree that my accepting this mission was inappropriate.

219
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.250
When I was invited, I didn't know...

220
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.680
That he was hitting on you?

221
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.540
I was aware of potential romantic motivations.

222
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.320
- And I was open to them. - Bam!

223
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.200
But I did not know you and I would be crossing paths.

224
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.220
You mean you didn't care,

225
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.260
because on one hand, you got professional ethics

226
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.269
and in the other hand, you got world-famous schlong?

227
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.260
- Now I get to beat you. - Bring it.

228
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.760
Alien vessel approaching Earth.

229
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.300
- It's hailing us. - Put it through.

230
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.420
- I don't work for you. - You couldn't. You suck.

231
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.685
I'll do it.

232
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.228
Mr. President.

233
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.220
Lady, you bring that ship to America's planet,

234
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.020
I'm launching 4,000 warheads,

235
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.110
3,000 of which will turn out to work.

236
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.740
Then I'll call China, and you're really fucked.

237
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.280
Let's listen to Unity.

238
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.820
- Are you still here? - Are you?

239
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.650
If I wanted Earth, I would have taken it.

240
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.669
- Oh, bullshit. - Give me a break.

241
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.750
You cut eight million pieces of me off.

242
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.180
- It hurt. - Boo-hoo.

243
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.320
You've made it clear we can't be friends, Rick,

244
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.180
but I need to reconnect those people

245
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.860
so I can properly release them.

246
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.520
They're hosting a mindless collective.

247
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.160
If it connects to another mind,

248
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.399
it could become its own colony.

249
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.310
Wow. You made a PowerPoint?

250
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.880
I needed you to understand

251
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.760
- how serious this is. - I can handle it.

252
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.120
We got the spray, bitch.

253
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.600
Don't talk to them like that.

254
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.570
Rick, do you not trust Unity?

255
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.960
- Shut up. - Apologize.

256
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.980
- Eat me. - Do you not trust me, Rick?

257
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.980
- Who would? - Let Rick answer.

258
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.449
Baby, I know you want to help, but...

259
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.849
Andre, I think we need to move slower.

260
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.410
Slower? I haven't even touched you,

261
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.779
and you're already back-seat war-rooming.

262
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.860
- Andre? - Helen.

263
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.480
- Rick? - I don't trust you.

264
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.410
You ghosted me to focus on your work.

265
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.280
Your work is absorbing the universe.

266
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.500
But it's my universe. Please go.

267
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.790
We'll spray the Virginians before they touch anyone.

268
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.870
I'm sorry you lost a finger, but that's the price

269
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.340
of surprise butt play.

270
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.060
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

271
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.464
Alien vessel is departing.

272
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.840
Good job, people.

273
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.009
I'll run the aerosol cannon from the chopper.

274
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.240
We need the optics. Send out a press release.

275
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.800
"President sprays Virginia with the opposite of bullets."

276
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.340
But write it better than that.

277
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.520
You riding shotgun, or you staying butt hurt?

278
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.980
Suck my dick and lose my number. You too.

279
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.620
If you invite me to the wedding, I will shit in the punch.

280
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:32.960
He'll be back.

281
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.540
What would you like for dinner?

282
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.560
I'm not interested in taking this further.

283
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.780
What? Why? That's insane!

284
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.980
How can you be a therapist and insane?

285
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.720
Since you're asking for feedback,

286
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.870
my sincere advice

287
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.660
is that you overcome your need for approval.

288
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.420
Okay. You want to play it that way?

289
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.320
There's an exit tunnel by the ladies' room.

290
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.560
It gets lots of use, and not just by sex workers.

291
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.884
Can you at least tell security I did the dumping?

292
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.320
- Uh, you okay? - Yes.

293
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.489
The news said Virginia was a hive-mind.

294
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.560
Yes.

295
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.650
- Was it... - Yes!

296
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.220
Oh, my God. Dude, whatever.

297
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.749
When's the last time you saw your therapist?

298
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.460
- Today. - Well, then, she sucks.

299
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.580
- No shit! - Stop yelling at me!

300
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.580
- I need boundaries. - Well, here's a big one, fuck face!

301
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.242
Sorry.

302
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.840
Arriving at the dome, sir.

303
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.440
Good. I don't need anybody.

304
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.450
- What? - What? I said good.

305
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.280
- Tell me when we're there. - We are.

306
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.965
Roger that. Just gonna see how we're looking.

307
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.460
And there's Helicopter One with the aforementioned gas,

308
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.800
and you can actually see President Curtis inside,

309
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.760
checking his phone to see if this will make people like him.

310
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.240
There he is frowning now, of course, as he realizes

311
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.110
no amount of spectacle is going to undo his last debacle.

312
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.040
- Shonda? - Oh, not Shonda.

313
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.760
- She hates me. - It's true, Tom.

314
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.720
I mean, yes, President Curtis is going to release Virginia

315
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.778
from yet another alien threat,

316
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.970
but when they are free to speak their minds,

317
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.710
does he really think they're going to say, "Wow. What a president"?

318
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.201
Deactivating dome, sir.

319
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.639
The fact is, nothing short of literally a 100% approval rating

320
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.640
is gonna save Curtis in the next election.

321
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.150
Let her rip, sir.

322
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.820
100% approval?

323
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.940
Whoopsie. I-I-I'll be right back.

324
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.760
- Sir? - I just gotta get the thing.

325
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.013
Wha'? Huh? How is that going to work?

326
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.560
Give it to me. Give me that hive!

327
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.280
Mother, forgive me. Just forgive me. I need it.

328
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.948
Holy...

329
00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.950
... shit!

330
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.060
Loved ones are gathered here to reunite with the captives,

331
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.140
who appear to walking, quite eagerly,

332
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.460
and now running, in perfect unison, toward them.

333
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.740
Such a beautiful scene... everyone kissing.

334
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.540
And now everyone that got kisses is kissing everyone else.

335
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.650
Heartfelt, almost disgusting kisses.

336
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.200
The wave of affection is headed in all directions.

337
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.240
Hello, sir.

338
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.300
The president has saved us. He's the best president.

339
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.400
The best man, really, ever.

340
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.725
- His mother was wrong. - Uh-oh.

341
00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.812
Did somebody close the lady tunnel?

342
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.490
Hey, Rick, w-w-was Unity...

343
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.390
She's gone, and I don't care.

344
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.032
- I think she's back. - Hmm?

345
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.660
Someone order cranky dick?

346
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.300
- I said I was sorry. - No, you didn't.

347
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.740
I said it quietly. Shut up.

348
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.320
Now, Governor, can you explain why all of Virginia ran

349
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.740
in all directions and puked on everyone in the country?

350
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.240
It's simple, news man.

351
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.070
They puke in love of the president.

352
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.590
We approve of the president. Everyone does.

353
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.320
Sorry, Governor,

354
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.140
but you're making me bring Shonda into this.

355
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.370
Thanks, Tom. Governor, I can assure you

356
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.950
that no matter how you personally may feel...

357
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.940
Good president.

358
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.620
President good, good, good.

359
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.960
Are you okay? Uh, Josh just vomited into your mou...

360
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.340
Oh. Ha. I get it now.

361
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.800
Wow! What a president.

362
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.940
- Approval here. - President approved.

363
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.890
I thought Unity promised to never do this.

364
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.960
That's not Unity.

365
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.520
You kids stay inside and lock up.

366
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.610
Dad's still out shopping.

367
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.879
Then stay inside, lock up, and plug your ears.

368
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.380
- Where are you going? - Therapy.

369
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.360
Thank God.

370
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.420
Huh?

371
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.490
Aah!

372
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.580
Aah!

373
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.860
You're rehired.

374
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.900
- Is that Unity? - It's your boyfriend.

375
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.840
He must have linked with the severed hive-mind.

376
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.340
He's going to assimilate the Earth faster than I can fight it.

377
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.710
And you want me to talk to him?

378
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.780
There's no talking to him.

379
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.460
No human mind can keep itself together

380
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.080
while controlling millions of people.

381
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.380
- So, where are we going? - I need Unity's help.

382
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.560
So, you need to convince her I'm worth it.

383
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.180
- You aren't. - So, lie.

384
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.043
Inbound vessel detected.

385
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.620
- Tell him to turn around. - Tell me in person.

386
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.070
- I'm already here. - God damn it.

387
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.380
But your ship was just...

388
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.499
You have your gimmicks, I have mine.

389
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.460
This is my therapist. She can vouch for me.

390
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.304
We met. She was me for a second. What do you want, Rick?

391
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.930
Look. It's clear you weren't lying

392
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.559
when you said you could've taken over Earth

393
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.640
because your finger just took over America.

394
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.269
I need you to help me fix that.

395
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.313
Oh. It took that to make you believe me?

396
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.360
Why should I believe you?

397
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.566
You show up unannounced and hijack a state.

398
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.400
I called you! Multiple times.

399
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.029
You ghosted me.

400
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.100
- Rick, is that true? - She dumped me.

401
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.400
Why would I answer her calls?

402
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.320
All right. I'm going to commit a cardinal sin

403
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.560
in couples' therapy here.

404
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.900
But Rick, I think you're wrong.

405
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.456
Bringing you was a mistake.

406
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.360
You had an outer-space lady who was worried for your life,

407
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.671
and your response was hostile enough to cause a huge problem.

408
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680
Thank you.

409
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.120
Now you're asking her to both forgive you and solve it?

410
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.530
Unity, I think the reason Rick brought me here

411
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.000
is that he doesn't know how to indicate to you he's changed,

412
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.440
because he's changing very slowly.

413
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.920
But he is.

414
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.840
All right. Anyone else wanna call me a baby?

415
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.840
Maybe we can drag this out until Earth is fully assimilated?

416
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.760
All right.

417
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.820
So, you're asking for an invasion?

418
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.220
Hold them back. They love me. They just forgot.

419
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.612
They just forgot. They just forgot.

420
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.600
No! Stop. You love me.

421
00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.520
What? Why are you stopping?

422
00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.704
I've won you over?

423
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.840
Oh, good. You're here.

424
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.020
Unity, kept them warm for you.

425
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.780
They went a little crazy, but, uh...

426
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.160
Anyway, seems like this is all over.

427
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.800
Helen, we could grab some coffee.

428
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.660
Wait. Unity, what are you doing?

429
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.120
All right, Rick. That's everyone.

430
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.720
Nice job, Une.

431
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.720
Well, this has been quite a session.

432
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.580
Hope you do group discounts.

433
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.350
Actually, just send the bill to the White House.

434
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.840
I wouldn't be doing this for anyone else, Rick.

435
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.820
Yeah. It was nice to team up again.

436
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.370
No. I mean I wouldn't be doing it.

437
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.280
I've never released hundreds of millions of people before.

438
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.660
This is gonna suck.

439
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.640
_

440
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.410
Here. It's over. Nice job, Une.

441
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.280
- I'm fine. - You want a painkiller?

442
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.150
I, uh, I'm on a few of them right now.

443
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.420
No, thank you.

444
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.920
I mean, you could hang out if you want,

445
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.540
come see the kids.

446
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.280
I trust you now.

447
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.660
That's nice, but I don't trust you.

448
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.120
Fair enough.

449
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.100
Hey, Rick, it's Unity.

450
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.650
Uh, give me a call, okay?

451
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.190
Hey, Rick. Unity.

452
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.620
Look. Cards on the table.

453
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.720
I heard you were going after that guy again.

454
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.160
Just made me worried. Give me a call.

455
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.060
Look. I get it. I dumped you. You're ignoring me.

456
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.250
But I care about you,

457
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.700
and I just wanna know you're all right.

458
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.600
Hey, Rick, listen. I'm just gonna stop by Virginia, okay?

459
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.220
I don't know what state you live in,

460
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.700
but I'll camp out there and try to reach you.

461
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.840
Hope you're okay.

462
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.040
Hey, Rick. David Miscavige here.

463
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.759
Heard you were saying some really great things

464
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.050
about Scientology.

465
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.349
If you ever wanna meet Travolta...

466
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.350
End playback!

467
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.620
You, uh, really went all in on that approval, huh?

468
00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.600
Yeah.

469
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.730
Shonda's gonna eat me alive.

470
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.122
Ah, fuck 'em.

471
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.440
Thanks, Rick.

472
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.800
Don't take this the wrong way,

473
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.720
but, uh, I think I might need therapy.

474
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.480
And we're back with Mr. Stabby.

475
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.215
What do you say to people who say, "I don't want to get stabbed.

476
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.660
I want to go a show.

477
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.052
I have a right to not get stabbed"?

478
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.340
Well, Gary, I have a right to arms and legs.

479
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.880
But I wasn't born with those.

480
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.030
And I don't think that means I should be boxed out

481
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.920
of an industry where, let's face it,

482
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.260
there's zero representation of people

483
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.890
with swords for arms and legs.

484
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.525
But do you have to take questions from the audience?

485
00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.260
People come to my show because they want the experience.

486
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.160
If they didn't want it, they'd stop coming.

487
00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.440
Your show has resulted in the deaths of 58,000 attendees.

488
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.370
Well, you're talking about it.
