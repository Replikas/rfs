1
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.960
I'm gonna rip out your spleen and feed it to your husband!

2
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.540
Uh-oh. Wouldn't want that.

3
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.840
Yikes, Morty. We'd better run before it figures out

4
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.132
what a husband is.

5
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.740
This carnival of nightmares used to be scary, right?

6
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.160
- Ah. We've seen too much. - It sucks, you know,

7
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.530
'cause it's fun to break off a scare now and then.

8
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.101
Did I hear you fellows wishing for some good old-fashioned scares?

9
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.060
I mean, I more wish you wouldn't eavesdrop.

10
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.140
Yeah. Who are you?

11
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860
Does the suit mean you work here,

12
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.524
or that you super don't work here?

13
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.220
Like yourselves, I'm a connoisseur of fear.

14
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.780
I'm also originally from Earth.

15
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.670
And did you know Earth is the home

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.180
of the single scariest place in the galaxy?

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.534
I can show you if you like.

18
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.037
We were headed that way anyway.

19
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.150
Take a left. Almost there.

20
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.340
We know where Earth is.

21
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.720
For guys like you, you know, who've seen it all,

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.754
there's only a few real fears left to conquer.

23
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.674
And one of them is right down here.

24
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080
- Okay. What the hell? - Yeah. This is punching down.

25
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.459
Denny's is a nice chain that gives people starchy food

26
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.939
- when they're up late. - It's a hack joke, buddy.

27
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.900
No. This is the place. Good luck to both of you.

28
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.188
I'm gonna get myself a slam.

29
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.880
He just wanted a ride, right?

30
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.300
He certainly took us for one.

31
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.900
Well, as long as we're here.

32
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.880
Okay. Lumberjack slam, grand slamwich,

33
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.960
pancake puppies, slamburger, two milkshakes...

34
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.480
and an order of cheddar tots.

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.759
Let me know when you want your cheque,

36
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.819
and if you're here for the Hole, it's in the men's bathroom.

37
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.180
- The what now? - Hole?

38
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.541
The Fear Hole. Men's bathroom.

39
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.400
Well, it's definitely a hole.

40
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.519
They weren't lying about that.

41
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.848
Is that hair? Seaweed?

42
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.440
Boy, it's really circling the whole rim, huh?

43
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.900
Guess you got to jump in without touching the sides?

44
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.760
You think there's spikes on the bottom?

45
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.879
I don't think they want you to go in there and just die.

46
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.099
What kind of business would that be?

47
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.409
Well, they're not drowning in money.

48
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.380
They still have a built-in TV/VCR.

49
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.459
- _ - Hey. It's that carnival guy.

50
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.940
Oh, so he gets a kickback.

51
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.360
Hi. Welcome to the Hole.

52
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.220
Here's how it works. You jump in.

53
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.200
The Hole manifests your greatest fear.

54
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.300
You conquer that fear, and come out, well, fearless.

55
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.200
And you get your picture on the wall.

56
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.459
What does the Hole get out of it?

57
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.660
Well, you know those fish that nibble dead skin off your feet?

58
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.360
Yeah. The Hole's kind of like that.

59
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.380
It eats fear.

60
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.580
You win. It wins.

61
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.330
Have fun and enjoy the Hole.

62
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.260
Hey, Gaddafi, cool your jets

63
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.620
with a taste of Mountain Dew.

64
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.690
This has been here since VHS tapes

65
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.280
and there's only three photos?

66
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.660
Yeah. My tots are getting cold.

67
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.260
So, you don't want to do it?

68
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.680
- Do you? - I mean...

69
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.900
It says it takes away your greatest fear.

70
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.200
My greatest fear, Morty,

71
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.338
is trusting a gross hole to conquer my fear,

72
00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.489
and I conquer that fear by walking away.

73
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.960
Okay, fine.

74
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.280
You little turd!

75
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.750
- Oh, God! - Oh, God!

76
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.470
Hold still while I stuff you with maggots.

77
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.180
Rick!

78
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.060
Okay. The Hole thinks I'm scared of not having a gun?

79
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.790
Fear conquered!

80
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.228
Check out them gains. Morty? Where are you, Morty?

81
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.600
Let's go.

82
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.600
- Oh, jeez. Oh, God. Oh, jeez. - Oh, man.

83
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.650
We both shit our pants.

84
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.358
- Christ, Rick. My button. - What a fucking ride.

85
00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.100
- Maggots! In my button. - Fuck, yeah.

86
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.491
- On the wall, motherfuckers! - It's not worth it. Not worth it!

87
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.020
Oh, my God. You both reek.

88
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.980
- What is that? - Morty and I shit our pants.

89
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.300
You're looking at the two newest members of the Hole club.

90
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.330
Uh, okay, sluts.

91
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.560
What the hell?

92
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.630
Bomb almost killed her.

93
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.460
Take care of our wife.

94
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.780
Rick? No. Oh, my God.

95
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.370
No. No!

96
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.340
- Mom? - Where am I? Who are you people?

97
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.799
You're my mom, but you're young?

98
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.397
- Rick, what's happening? - Wait.

99
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.816
Rick?

100
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.420
What the fuck, Grandpa? Say something.

101
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.859
Okay. We're clearly still in the Hole.

102
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.979
That's exactly what I was thinking.

103
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.099
We never left the Hole and...

104
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.059
And part of the Hole is thinking you left the Hole and then...

105
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.299
And then it can really dig into you.

106
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.979
Because you can't really be scared of anything if you know you're...

107
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.830
Still in the Hole.

108
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.179
What the fuck are you two talking about?

109
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.330
Why is dead Grandma alive in our living room?

110
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.835
Rick, why are you old?

111
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.980
All great questions.

112
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.469
You guys get reacquainted while we grab some equipment.

113
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.580
Wait. Are we sure this isn't, like, a double mislead?

114
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.900
A double mislead like we went into a generic fear hole

115
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.970
and then coincidentally came home to that?

116
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.920
That's... That's my wife.

117
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.558
From the day I lost her.

118
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.420
Well, what's it got to do with me?

119
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.687
- Rick. - Right.

120
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.300
I think I figured it out, Morty.

121
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.200
Your greatest fear is me getting Diane back

122
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.190
- and being happy again. - What? Why?

123
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.500
Because then I won't need you.

124
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.099
Look how scared you're getting just talking about it.

125
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.947
I'm not scared. I'm insulted.

126
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.030
What kind of backhanded-ass theory is that?

127
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.909
My greatest fear is you hooking up?

128
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.760
You're right. We can't know for sure until I get more data.

129
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.957
All right, family. Who wants to catch up over ice cream?

130
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.680
I knew he was working on teleportation.

131
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.879
But wouldn't this be time travel?

132
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.010
Oh, Dad never touches time travel.

133
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.040
He calls it the Long...

134
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.640
The Long Island Iced Tea of science fiction. Yes.

135
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.560
But then, what... what is this?

136
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.759
Don't worry about it. It's not real.

137
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.260
Okay. I figure it's better to do this in front of you.

138
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.939
I didn't want to walk in De-aged.

139
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.720
What do you think, D? 45? Younger?

140
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.540
I don't care about your age, Rick.

141
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.709
I don't even want to call you that.

142
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.120
That's my husband's name.

143
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.940
- He just died. - I know.

144
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.240
So, 27?

145
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.010
Dad! You're traumatizing her.

146
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.530
What? It's my face, too.

147
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.799
And now Diane gets to understand

148
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.700
that I'm still sexy and a genius.

149
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.980
What a kindness.

150
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.121
You were right, Rick. I'm really terrified right now.

151
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.160
Terrified of what?

152
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.040
If you don't mind, I'd like to get to know

153
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.918
the adult version of my...

154
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.460
Oh, my God.

155
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.250
Where's my real daughter?

156
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.400
Sweetie, it's all right.

157
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.960
This may as well be our real daughter

158
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.520
because she's just as real as you.

159
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.640
- What? - Put it this way.

160
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.280
You're all basically NPCs.

161
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.400
Only Morty and I are real,

162
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.931
so your side quests don't matter.

163
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.730
- The main quest is us. - You're disgusting.

164
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.720
You're talking about our baby girl like she's theoretical?

165
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.950
Welcome to the family.

166
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.200
No. You don't get it, honey.

167
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.260
Even if this was real,

168
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.789
she'd be only a version of your daughter

169
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.159
who could also be a clone of your daughter.

170
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.280
Stop wearing my husband's face!

171
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.488
You're nothing like him.

172
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.781
Because I lost you!

173
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.070
Maybe you didn't deserve me.

174
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.850
You want to hear a new theory?

175
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.800
Maybe your greatest fear

176
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.520
is getting a second chance with her and blowing it.

177
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.640
You don't think that fear's been pretty well faced?

178
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.480
Then you haven't conquered it.

179
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.799
Or accepted it. Or something.

180
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.500
- "Or something?" - I'm not a fear-ologist.

181
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.320
Morty, all Rom-coms have an arc.

182
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.859
Even "You've Got Mail" begins with Tom Hanks killing that cop.

183
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.874
- Really? - I don't know.

184
00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:14.489
I'm not going to fucking watch "You've Got Mail."

185
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.000
I'm doing this for you, Morty.

186
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.120
The sooner I get her back,

187
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.700
the sooner you can conquer your fear of being a useless, lonely turd.

188
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.734
You don't think that's been faced?

189
00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:27.364
_

190
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.280
âª Hello, Diane, here's the song I rehearsed âª

191
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.850
âª You had a bad day and Rick made it worse âª

192
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.360
âª He felt bad, so he created me âª

193
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.417
âª I deliver you waffles and an apology âª

194
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.720
Why do I have memories of being a human child?

195
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.380
- Why would I need... - Shit, shit, shit.

196
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.240
God damn it. There was a whole second verse

197
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.949
about inviting you to the zoo with the family.

198
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.770
I've seen that robot's arms.

199
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.580
Yeah. I used them on a law enforcement drone

200
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.888
that the feds had me build.

201
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.720
It's how we, uh... How I met my wife.

202
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.228
The zoo sounds nice.

203
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.060
And this one time, we raised a civilization

204
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.300
living on a zit on my face,

205
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.200
and Grandpa helped me rule over it as queen.

206
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.720
It sounds like you guys are a real family now.

207
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.660
I wish you could've been part of it, Mom.

208
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.364
Oh.

209
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.390
Oh, honey.

210
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.700
Rick, is there a deadline on this theory you're chasing?

211
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.200
Uh, yeah, sure. Uh, that's a good idea, Morty.

212
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.539
Do that.

213
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.710
I always wished I knew what they were saying.

214
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.980
Your Master's thesis. Non-human intelligence.

215
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.720
When did you read that?

216
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.969
After you were gone.

217
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.700
It helped me develop this.

218
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.340
Fuck you! Fuck you, Greg.

219
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.138
- Fuck you, Lisa. Yum, bread. - No,

220
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.559
- fuck you. - Fuck you. There's bread.

221
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.899
I guess that's what I expected.

222
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.300
Anticlimactic, isn't it?

223
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.790
Yep. They kind of suck.

224
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.020
Hey. Want to grab a drink?

225
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.401
- Hey-hey! - Woo! Yeah.

226
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.903
All right. Woo!

227
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.350
_

228
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.080
So, when did you stop being a lightweight?

229
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.480
Kept looking for my wife at the bottom of a bottle.

230
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.000
You're pathetic.

231
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.400
Hey. To being pathetic.

232
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.130
Clear!

233
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.550
_

234
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.850
_

235
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.750
_

236
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.919
My turn. My turn.

237
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.890
I'll tell you what, old man.

238
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.340
Seems like losing me made you cooler.

239
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.870
I should die more often.

240
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.540
You did.

241
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.420
You died everywhere forever.

242
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.210
You're the only thing I can't replace.

243
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.560
Okay, okay, Mr. Weepy.

244
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.680
I'm not even real, remember?

245
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.260
Nothing's real. That's your jam, right?

246
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.870
My grandson, our grandson, thinks this is happening

247
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.860
because my greatest fear is letting you go.

248
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.890
Then don't.

249
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.380
- I don't want to. - Then kiss me.

250
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.260
I'm old, and we have puke mouth.

251
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.440
Well, I'm not here, and it's not real puke.

252
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.480
- Okay, Rick... Whoa! Dude. - Fuck you, Morty.

253
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.999
- It's a blazer. - That's not what I meant.

254
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.190
You look sick.

255
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.539
The Hole is feeding on you.

256
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.327
I thought it's supposed to eat my fear.

257
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.839
Can we get some fucking rules up in this hole?

258
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.780
I don't know the rules. Maybe you're dying

259
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.290
because you've been in here too long.

260
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.490
Interesting theory.

261
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.090
I wonder why you're so rosy-cheeked.

262
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.699
- What are you saying? - Maybe the real you

263
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.260
is off somewhere running from spiders.

264
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.720
Oh. So, now I'm not real?

265
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.649
Yeah. Maybe my greatest fear is having to tell you

266
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.660
to fuck the fuck off.

267
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.400
- Go ahead and face it. - Fuck the fuck off!

268
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.470
Hey. Ready to Showbiz Pizza?

269
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.300
Let me see that bear play banjo.

270
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
Here's one for you.

271
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.340
I'm afraid of watching you die.

272
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.812
I like that theory, Morty. So, stop watching.

273
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.820
Okay, this is it. You nailed it.

274
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.180
My worst nightmare.

275
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.940
I'd like to leave the Hole now.

276
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.300
Hey. Hey, Hole, I'm talking to you.

277
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.400
Are you listening?

278
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.700
So, what are you? Like, the Hole?

279
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.880
The Hole's promoter?

280
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.000
- The Hole's intern? - Is there a hole here?

281
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.800
Right. I'm supposed to go in there and be shocked

282
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.240
that there's no hole, or that there is a hole.

283
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.510
What difference would it make?

284
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.599
Hmm. You are hard to scare.

285
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.960
And Rick isn't, right?

286
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.300
The Hole's gonna, like, suck on him forever

287
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.020
because his big secret is that he's got the most fear?

288
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.720
Well, we can certainly say you're not afraid to be reductive.

289
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.679
I doubt your grandpa has more fear

290
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.230
than the average asshole in a Denny's.

291
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240
- Hey! - Sorry.

292
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.330
If anything, he seems pretty brave.

293
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.879
He's certainly not afraid to die.

294
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.060
Maybe that makes his fear extra-delicious.

295
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.700
So, what, he's scared of love?

296
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.500
Everyone's scared of love, dipshit.

297
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.770
You learn that in your 20s.

298
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.300
It takes a very rare, very powerful being

299
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.750
to be terrified of happiness.

300
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.970
- Dumb. - You're dumb.

301
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.529
That's why you're not scared to be happy.

302
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.090
The smarter you are, the more you know.

303
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.940
Happiness is a trap. It can't last forever.

304
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.499
Let's say you meet the love of your life.

305
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.180
Well, it's still gonna end.

306
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.290
It's inevitable, whether by the slow pull of a disease,

307
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.560
or the shock of loose footing on a hiking trail.

308
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.920
Whether it be the corrosion of two personalities

309
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.100
that reshape each other until they're incompatible,

310
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.740
or maybe the old stranger in a bar

311
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.400
who says the things that need to be said,

312
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.869
to that person, that night.

313
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.400
The point is, happiness always ends.

314
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.829
Best-case scenario. Think about this.

315
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.250
Best case is that you die at the same time.

316
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.294
Yikes.

317
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.880
Can't the Hole just let me go, then?

318
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.580
- Sounds like I don't matter. - You don't.

319
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.179
But if you go, you'll take him away.

320
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.218
Don't worry. Rick will die before accepting happiness.

321
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.310
After that, we'll chase you with some clowns

322
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.760
or some dumb shit like that.

323
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.420
But Grandpa...

324
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.976
Yummy, yummy. Grandpa's gonna die.

325
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.500
Just like Diane.

326
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.660
Sir, you've been in this booth for a really long time.

327
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.700
- One coffee isn't gonna cut it. - That's fair.

328
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.770
- Want to split some pancake puppies? - No!

329
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.660
Beth? Summer? Anyone?

330
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.831
Dad, it's not real. Neither are you.

331
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.100
If that's true, then you deal with it.

332
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.100
You know what? You're right.

333
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.382
- How about this? - Morty, what are you doing?

334
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.467
Being scared.

335
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.100
How is that not enough fear?

336
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.800
You're the one scaring me, Morty.

337
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.220
- No, no, Dad, it's okay. - It's not okay.

338
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.520
That wasn't normal.

339
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.700
My greatest fear is not being accepted.

340
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.920
It should be.

341
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.140
And you need to fear it a hell of a lot more.

342
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.530
I can do that.

343
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.900
You like that?

344
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.040
Do you want to die?

345
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.704
I have enough unaddressed trauma to flood this hallway.

346
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.940
- _ - You fucking idiot.

347
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.500
This list says "Top Five Things,"

348
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.220
and you only wrote down four.

349
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.180
Trust fall.

350
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.730
None of us touch or speak to this kid ever.

351
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.880
Maybe take a picture,

352
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.400
- send it to your friends? - Huh.

353
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.260
Not a bad idea.

354
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.940
How can we do the school play if Johnny has laryngitis?

355
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.449
- There's no understudy. - Put me in the play.

356
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.774
You don't know the lines.

357
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.260
Yes, I do. "Three Days of Rain."

358
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.580
I have it memorized.

359
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.659
And I refuse to prove that until you cast me.

360
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.230
Have it your way, but The New York Times is coming,

361
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.160
and they're doing a feature on the current state

362
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.520
of young American theatre.

363
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.789
Perfect.

364
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.999
It ended in a church?

365
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.160
- What? - Yeah, they'd already died.

366
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.800
It was purgatory or something.

367
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.239
How did your universe's version end?

368
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.760
Hmm. Jack, Locke, and Sawyer teamed up to kill a fog monster

369
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:43.900
and everyone got rescued.

370
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.428
It was one season long, and it was perfect television.

371
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.960
You can be great or you can be around forever, right?

372
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.308
True. True. True. True.

373
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.610
- True. True. - Where's this going?

374
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.240
- We doing robot role play? - True. True.

375
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.080
- I've got oil at home. - True. True. True.

376
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.730
- What was that? Diane. - True. True.

377
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.359
- Diane? Diane? - Hey.

378
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.720
- Stay with me. - Diane. Diane.

379
00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.820
- Diane? - Rick?

380
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.560
- What's happening? - Fucking Morty.

381
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.140
He's trying to hog the Hole.

382
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.200
Come on.

383
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.535
_

384
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.100
Alas, our father is dead.

385
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.170
Walker, are you here?

386
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.341
Uh, hi. I'm Walker.

387
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.968
Uh...

388
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.310
Sure has been raining a lot of days.

389
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.600
What the fuck is he doing?

390
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.980
What's wrong with him?

391
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.145
He's naked.

392
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.240
And why does he look sick?

393
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.790
Because he's dying.

394
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.943
Fuck.

395
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.260
I got to get him out of here.

396
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.400
But if I do, I might have to go with him.

397
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.700
I don't want to. I don't want to, Diane.

398
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.670
I think my greatest fear is letting you go.

399
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.460
That's a good fear, Rick. Keep that fear.

400
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.240
If you don't, you'll kill me.

401
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.560
Again.

402
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.240
I know. But I don't have to kill Morty, too.

403
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.940
How do you know he's even real?

404
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.960
Look at his weird little balls.

405
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.670
Goodbye, Diane.

406
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.050
- Rick? - Shut up, Morty.

407
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.475
DJ, drop that beat. We got to conquer a fear.

408
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.740
âª This is my grandson âª

409
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.980
âª Don't look at his pee-pee âª

410
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.857
âª Instead of staring at Morty âª âª Put your eyes on me-me âª

411
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.860
âª I'm a roped-out freak âª

412
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.280
âª Loose dog in my ass âª

413
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.540
âª Macaroni in my pocket âª

414
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.154
âª Rickety masterclass âª

415
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.420
âª I don't know how to rap âª

416
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.680
âª I don't know how to rhyme âª

417
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.220
âª I don't know how to rap âª

418
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.680
âª Now eat my shit âª

419
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.800
Incredible.

420
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.040
âª Now throw your hands up âª

421
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.610
âª And put your hands down âª

422
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.750
âª Throw your hands up âª

423
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.417
âª Now put them back down âª

424
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.420
âª Three days of rain âª

425
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.420
That was an astounding feat of personal bravery.

426
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.387
Nudity always makes theatre serious and good.

427
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.890
How do you feel?

428
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.530
Accepted. You?

429
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.540
Pathetic. But... happy?

430
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.451
We did it. We conquered our fears. Right?

431
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.164
Uh, hey, Rick?

432
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.860
You just looked real sad, which I'm afraid of.

433
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.800
You know, of being responsible for your sadness.

434
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.820
Which means I think we might still be in the Hole.

435
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.160
Huh. Well, I am definitely afraid of you

436
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.800
ever knowing anything before me.

437
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.556
So, yeah, I'd say there's a 100% chance that we're still...

438
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.730
God damn it. Is this going to be a whole thing?

439
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.880
No word play, Morty.

440
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.319
We have to figure out our actual fears

441
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.419
if we're ever going to get out of here.

442
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.940
- Actual fears? - Yeah.

443
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.669
Tell me your fucking fear so we can conquer it.

444
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.260
I just had to crucify myself

445
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.220
in order to save you from your Hole wife,

446
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.850
and you think I'm the one with unresolved fears?

447
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.619
I ought to be afraid that we'll never get out,

448
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.450
because you'll never admit that you're afraid.

449
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.020
Okay. Good job.

450
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.240
You conquered it, right?

451
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.710
I think so. How are we supposed to know?

452
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.629
No, no. This is real. I can tell.

453
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.089
You're not afraid that you could be certain about something

454
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.549
and still turn out to be wrong?

455
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.080
You cowardly asshole!

456
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.637
How was I supposed to know?

457
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.090
$8 for a side of bacon?

458
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.119
Are you fucking kidding me?

459
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.960
It's a symptom of a larger concern, Morty.

460
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.380
- If capitalism collapses... - Are we done here?

461
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.299
I don't know. Aren't you a little afraid at this point

462
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.485
- of the Hole itself? - What?

463
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.640
I swear to God, if we're still climbing out

464
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.400
of this fucking hole two seasons from now...

465
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.000
- Maybe that was it. - What?

466
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.840
Maybe we needed to let go of our fear of uncertainty.

467
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.640
- You know? - Right.

468
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.997
I'd say we're pretty native to that at this point.

469
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.900
- Okay. Thank you, Hole. - Thank you, Hole.

470
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.940
We no longer need to know if we're in you.

471
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.640
So, bye.

472
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.780
Are you afraid we're still in it?

473
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.460
I mean, I hope we're not,

474
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.370
- but if we are... - We'll find out eventually.

475
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.740
Which no longer scares me.

476
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.520
Same. Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk.

477
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.060
âª "Move on," they say âª

478
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.880
âª You'll feel better with time âª

479
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.020
âª But time alone can't heal this heart of mine âª

480
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.954
âª You can't go back âª

481
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.332
âª That's the only rule âª

482
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.780
âª But rules were meant to break when it comes to you âª

483
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.883
âª I saw time and time âª

484
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.302
âª Slip by when I withdrew âª

485
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.224
âª I wandered far and wide without you âª

486
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.728
âª Without you âª

487
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.600
âª Ooh-ooh âª

488
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.600
âª Ooh-ooh-ooh âª

489
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.320
âª Ooh-ooh âª

490
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.610
- âª So, I bury my dead âª - _

491
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.412
âª And I try to start again âª

492
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:09.540
âª But it'll never be the same as it was back then âª

493
00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.460
âª I've seen time and time âª

494
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.030
âª Slip by, but I'll make do âª

495
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.340
- âª 'Cause I won't live my life âª - Oh, my God!

496
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.730
I've turned into my dad.

497
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.260
Oh, maybe there's no way out.

498
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.720
Maybe we were born here.

499
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.894
Come on. We're gonna get through this.

500
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.437
I'm staying here.

501
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.620
No. We're Rick and Morty. I'm not leaving without you.

502
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.983
What did you say?

503
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.379
I said I'm not leaving you in here.

504
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.028
Come on. You're irreplaceable...

505
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.400
irreplaceable... irreplaceable... irreplaceable...

506
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.990
- What? - Oh, my God.

507
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.720
I know what I'm afraid of.

508
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.411
I'm afraid you'd never say that in real life.

509
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.249
I'm afraid that if I jumped into a hole,

510
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.260
you wouldn't even bother jumping in after me.

511
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.080
You'd just stand there and watch.

512
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.460
This entire thing has been about me.

513
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.620
You're not even in the Hole, are you?

514
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.800
Thank you for visiting the Fear Hole, Morty.

515
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.221
Your fear of relying on Rick has been delicious.

516
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.681
Dear God!

517
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.268
Morty, how was it?

518
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.645
Was it spiders?

519
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.600
Oh. Oh, jeez. Oh, my God, no.

520
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.080
You... You didn't go in at all?

521
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.568
No. It's a one-person ride.

522
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.560
You can't face two fears at the same time.

523
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.781
If my fear was fire and yours was water...

524
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.449
I get it. It's fine.

525
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.399
It really is fine. Huh.

526
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.580
You do seem a little less burdened.

527
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.500
Rick, am I irreplaceable?

528
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.620
I mean, define irreplaceable.

529
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.380
That's good. Good.

530
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.580
I'm back.

531
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.700
Don't! Or I won't know if I'm out.

532
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.040
- Is it that good? Should I go in? - No!

533
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.580
You holding out on me?

534
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.390
You don't want to deal with it, Rick.

535
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.684
There was messed-up mental shit in there.

536
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.980
Like, Diane was in there.

537
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.500
- What? - Not in a good way.

538
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.000
Just trust me.

539
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.640
Okay, buddy. Let's go slam some pancakes.

540
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.039
_

541
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.830
Oo-wee. How 'bout that?

542
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.640
Season 7.

543
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.880
It was touch and go there for a second.

544
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.420
Remember when I stole my kid?

545
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.740
I stole one of these, too.

546
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.500
- Huh? - It's all about having a goal

547
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.230
and stopping at nothing to achieve it.

548
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.130
Then you'll be fulfilled.
