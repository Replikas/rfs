1
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.280
Wow, another adventure where I went up an ass.

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.040
Oh, good, are we having this fight again?

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.880
L-let me guess, y-you're gonna leave or, or throw a sulking fit?

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.039
You think you know everything, Rick,

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.920
but you're basically just a giant 8-year-old.

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.230
I'm not doing this anymore.

7
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.579
Either you're in or you're out, Morty.

8
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.960
I'm tired of you weaponizing this half-assed threat.

9
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.780
You want out, then fucking quit!

10
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.520
You know what? You're right.

11
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.840
Sorry to be such a high-maintenance Morty.

12
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.520
Why don't I get you a drink?

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040
Oh, oh, hey, Morty!

14
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.070
Hey, Rick. You drunk yet?

15
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.829
You're my little buddy. You know that?

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.400
I-it's you and me, Morty.

17
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.760
Rick and Morty, 100 years. Forever.

18
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.420
Yeah, pal. Rick and Morty, 100 years.

19
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.740
Forever.

20
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.240
G-g-get off me.

21
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.700
W-w-what are you doing?

22
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.920
Ahhhh!

23
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.440
_

24
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.090
An eye patch? You know how we feel about pirates.

25
00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:16.285
_

26
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.960
Oh, my God! What is happening!

27
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.971
_

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.160
Do your worst you little bastards! Kill me! Do it!

29
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.486
Do it!

30
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.245
_

31
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.120
It works! Now we can visit infinite universes!

32
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.660
- Hooray! - But doesn't that mean

33
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.580
infinite other families can do the same?

34
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.080
Honey, infinite families don't invent the world's first...

35
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100
It works!

36
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.060
Oh, do you realize how free and empowered I just made us?

37
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.500
I did it! Best father ever!

38
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.417
_

39
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.960
Ah!

40
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.220
And how were the horrors of the infinite today, sir?

41
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.240
Ahh...

42
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.100
Just another day in paradise.

43
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.700
_

44
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.900
_

45
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.260
Motherfucker!

46
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.159
Well, not the stealthiest technique,

47
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.940
but if this guy doesn't know I'm hunting him,

48
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.050
he's not worth hunting.

49
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.280
It's just good to see you outside the subbasement.

50
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.020
Even if you never kill the version of yourself that killed your wife,

51
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.260
giving it your best shot, it looks good on you.

52
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.939
Thanks, buddy. It means a lot that your bar

53
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.863
for mental health has gotten lower than mine.

54
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.470
A good wind stays under the wings, baby!

55
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.940
Merging dimensions to consolidate my decoys, huh?

56
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.500
Kind of... first-thought...

57
00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:54.461
- _ - ... but the... craftsmanship,

58
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.060
pretty impressive... for a lesser Rick.

59
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.500
What the fuck are you doing? Oh, shit!

60
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.700
Evil Morty! Sho-should I grab the net?!

61
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.939
Yes!

62
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.510
Hang tight, Morty's getting the net.

63
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.390
Wait. Is this what I think it is?

64
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.517
Of course it is. Everything's what I think it is.

65
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.700
You're basically fracking the Central Finite Curve

66
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.400
to flush out a version of yourself?

67
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.898
Shouldn't you be turning yourself into a pickle?

68
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.339
What do you care what I do to the Curve?

69
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.139
I-I thought your whole gimmick was fucking off.

70
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.528
Certainly what made me a fan.

71
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.140
You're right, I don't live here,

72
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.365
which is why it's insane that you're still bugging me.

73
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.240
The shockwaves have more range than I thought.

74
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.580
Jesus, you heard a compliment?

75
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.200
A monkey humping a shotgun has "more range than he thought."

76
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.990
- Look at this scan array. - Don't touch!

77
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.009
Why would I touch it when I don't want it improved?

78
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.340
- Improved? - You're hitting infinite targets.

79
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.720
At least filter for probability stasis.

80
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.172
I was gonna. Duh.

81
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.340
I can't find the net! Sh-should we just shoot him?

82
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.830
You really think a douche that smug

83
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.220
doesn't keep a force field on?

84
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.860
Yeah, listen to Pop-Pop, Morty.

85
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.840
Eh. I'd be an idiot if I didn't check.

86
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.700
Uh-huh.

87
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.937
Well, I'm not gonna backpedal every time I do it.

88
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.090
You-you changing something?

89
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.520
He's filtering for probability stasis.

90
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.520
Ugh, are you still here?

91
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.654
- And are you just teeing him up now? - What?

92
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.440
See?

93
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.660
- Is that the guy? - Probably.

94
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.550
You're acting like this one's different.

95
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.790
He is different. But different doesn't mean him.

96
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.420
- Could be a trap. - I'll explain.

97
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.149
He's worried that it's actually your target

98
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.900
and he'd owe me credit for the kill.

99
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.220
Are you serious right now?

100
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.010
- You little narcissist. - Dude, literal glass house.

101
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.299
You think you're better than me?

102
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.180
Jesus, I hope so!

103
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.681
Can I offer my two cents?

104
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.340
- No! - Morty, no!

105
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.820
Well, that's different.

106
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.688
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

107
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.920
- All right! Yes! - Aw, jeez.

108
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.380
Everybody look at the bright side.

109
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.220
Evil Morty got to experience being wrong before he died.

110
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.300
It's true, that's what I get for talking to you

111
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.560
- instead of killing you. - What is this place?

112
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.320
I assume a box to contain Ricks

113
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.000
that get too close to the big guy.

114
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.610
Are you basing that on what you'd do? Since you're all the same.

115
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.230
I'm basing it on the ensemble of thematic Ricks

116
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.990
huddled opposite your POV.

117
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.030
Fresh meat.

118
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.342
- Pick a lane, buddy. - Yeah,

119
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.659
you can't do the "Fresh Meat" line

120
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.910
while cowering in shadow.

121
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.360
You get here same way we did? Hunting Rick Prime?

122
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.440
How did you arrive with two Mortys?

123
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.976
Attachment is death, bro.

124
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.569
That's what I've learned chasing this guy.

125
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.300
Instead of Ricksplaining how we all ended up

126
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.440
in a Roach Motel, let's pool some data.

127
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.316
- Who got here first? - Me.

128
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.111
I knocked off three clones for this door prize.

129
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.488
Oh, wow, three.

130
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.830
He killed my wife!

131
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.199
We know.

132
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.730
You son of a bitch! You killed my wife!

133
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.120
Is it just this?

134
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.129
Is this the torture?

135
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.660
Looks like there's enough of you to start the next ride!

136
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.620
That or just one really heavy Rick.

137
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.100
This whole thing is automated,

138
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.120
which I do point out specifically to enhance the humiliation.

139
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.386
Here we go!

140
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.819
If you're seeing this,

141
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.850
you're me, except, you know, less.

142
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.500
But you acted like you were better,

143
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.470
so I killed your beloved Diane.

144
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.860
Partly to devastate you,

145
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.280
mostly so I only have to record one message.

146
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.580
Some of you may have noticed

147
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.700
that it's not just your Diane that's gone.

148
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.740
She's also been erased from every universe across infinity.

149
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.363
And you might be wondering why.

150
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.770
I'd rather hear how.

151
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.640
Diane was wiped from all existence

152
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.360
by The Weapon Too Cool for a Name.

153
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.540
The Omega Device.

154
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.780
Known to inferiors as The Omega Device.

155
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.119
I heard the name from an inferior.

156
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.410
And it's my weapon.

157
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.400
But it's your fault I had to use it on her.

158
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.589
So if you want to see the Rick

159
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.500
that ruined your life, look around.

160
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.780
There's so many of you.

161
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.600
But that's why I want to make a deal.

162
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.460
One of you is going to get your Diane back.

163
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.969
He's lying. He's lying!

164
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.973
All you have to do is be the last Rick left.

165
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.500
Got that out of your system?

166
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.816
He can't bring her back!

167
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.870
Ah!

168
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.660
Wait, wait, wait! I'm a nice Rick.

169
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.700
- Eh. Pass. - You're such a dick!

170
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.371
We could've worked together!

171
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.280
Actually, I'm nice enough to not lie about this.

172
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.050
I was definitely gonna kill you guys.

173
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.240
Ah!

174
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.620
- Oh, hey, guys. - I'm clear, Rick! Take the shot!

175
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.239
I thought you wanted to "work together."

176
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.379
Just until you could kill him!

177
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.940
And they call me Evil Morty.

178
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.270
The easiest way out of any box

179
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.920
is to be the least shaped like a box.

180
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.280
We both hate Rick Prime more than each other anyway.

181
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.009
- Where'd you get that? - He's the worst Rick.

182
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.460
Big deal. The worst turd is a pizza.

183
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.660
Whoa!

184
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.680
Tough customer.

185
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.120
How is the worst turd a-a pizza?

186
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.520
Ah!

187
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.720
- Oh, shit! - Oh, shit!

188
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.389
Seems like he doesn't play well with others.

189
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.120
We all cool just killing this guy?

190
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.330
- Yeah. - Uh-huh.

191
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.500
Great job, final Rick!

192
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.880
Or if you were just one fat Rick, impressive cardio!

193
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.550
And now the big reveal.

194
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.553
Do you get Diane back?

195
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.097
Not in any real sense, because when I build a weapon, it works.

196
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.640
It's called being talented.

197
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.400
But I do have a Diane that promises to be with you until death.

198
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.140
But I'd get to the death part fast.

199
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.260
You don't want to be in here when this place resets.

200
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.360
- Rick? - Hey, Diane.

201
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.782
You sucked at eating pussy!

202
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.160
Clearly just said to be hurtful,

203
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.869
but I also won't deny it. I was young.

204
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.220
God, I miss that face.

205
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.319
Rick, you never told me he killed your wife across infinity.

206
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.260
Yeah, now I want to meet this guy, too.

207
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.770
I don't want to talk about this.

208
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.927
I always thought your Dick smelled weird!

209
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.345
Or that.

210
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.790
Come on b-baby, g-give my g-ghost a k-kiss.

211
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.814
Mwah.

212
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.060
You taking her to go?

213
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.190
Whoa!

214
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.480
Looks like we survived the box.

215
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.620
You should count chickens professionally, Morty.

216
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.830
I didn't trigger that!

217
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.333
All right, let's bail before this oven self-cleans.

218
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.879
What do you think? Sub-ether barrier blocking the portal fluid?

219
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.359
Can't be that. Mine would get through it.

220
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.470
Here, gimme that.

221
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.222
Don't freak out. I'm gonna tweak this.

222
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.315
Carry the two,

223
00:11:21.316 --> 00:11:23.320
- hold the three... - You need some kind of vector.

224
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.440
I was getting there.

225
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.040
The goo! The goo from the trap!

226
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.170
Come on, go, go, go!

227
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.110
Whoa, jeez! That was insane!

228
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.020
I-I can't believe you were excited for that!

229
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.410
I'm excited for this.

230
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.915
Clearly no one's escaped that place before.

231
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.550
Really learned your lesson about chasing this guy.

232
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.320
Hey, man, you can leave now.

233
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.712
That's true, I can.

234
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.280
The weapon, Morty.

235
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.220
He knows a thing that wipes someone out across all dimensions

236
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.870
could wipe him out across all dimensions.

237
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.179
_

238
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.200
- Holy shit. - So that's the guy?

239
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.370
- You're exhausting. - Can't help it, I'm a rascal.

240
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.522
Morty, you can't come!

241
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.970
Evil Morty, stay out of my way!

242
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.525
Gonna kill my nemesis!

243
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.770
Rick out!

244
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.238
He's a weird guy.

245
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.532
So Rick's right? You're afraid of the weapon?

246
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.940
What happens if Rick actually kills this guy?

247
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.340
You ever think about that?

248
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.662
Maybe he'll kill himself next.

249
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.670
You're an asshole.

250
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.240
Well, yeah. I'm not "Good" Morty.

251
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.520
Come or don't. I don't care.

252
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.880
Oh.

253
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.080
Shit.

254
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.009
Got to be honest, I totally thought you were coming.

255
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.060
No, no, I-I was.

256
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.340
I-I took a heroic step toward the portal,

257
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.380
- but then it closed. - Yeah, yeah, come on.

258
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.314
Pri-i-i-i-i-i-me!

259
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.690
Aw, man.

260
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.000
- What's up? - He built it again.

261
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.480
Pretty impressive.

262
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.350
Well, yeah, he's me with free time.

263
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.575
All right, I don't see a place to park.

264
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.130
Catch your breath and then keep that heat off my back.

265
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.750
If you die, I'm taking your stuff.

266
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.003
Ugh, gross.

267
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.400
All right, cool, let's do it.

268
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.810
- God dammit! - What?

269
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.330
No one can do undercuts but you?

270
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.790
- You brought Morty? - I'm not worried about him.

271
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.940
I'm evil!

272
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.720
Um, R-R-Rick? I-Is this... ?

273
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.780
You guys don't do anything small, huh?

274
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.900
I'm surprised he hasn't...

275
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.499
- All right, here we go! - There it is.

276
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.026
- Yep. - Wow, the Wife Guy!

277
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.080
Dead Wife Rick!

278
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.989
I'll tell you, this guy does not know when to quit.

279
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.572
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

280
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.000
You brought two Mortys with you?

281
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.700
What? They're your cheering section?

282
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.327
We brought ourselves, asshole.

283
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.038
Honestly, Wife Guy, I do miss when it was just us.

284
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.440
The only two Ricks who actually invented portal travel.

285
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.260
Anyone else teed up to arrive later? Like your car?

286
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.380
I can see why you hate him.

287
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.960
And she sounds like our wife!

288
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.580
Like in a fucked-up robot way,

289
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.200
but that's definitely her voice.

290
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.080
You sentimental lil' fella.

291
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.140
Right, good instincts. I would've tried that, too.

292
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.620
I upgraded this thing, by the way.

293
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.982
The new version can fire more than once.

294
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.330
So now I can erase your whole family, one-by-one,

295
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.160
until you finally learn your lesson.

296
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.380
Which you won't, so then I'll kill you too.

297
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.320
I'll do that the old-fashioned way.

298
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.030
Okay, family killin' time!

299
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.998
Let's start small. Still family though.

300
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.580
Where am I? Two Ricks?

301
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.670
Where's my wife? I was just with my wife!

302
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.300
Uncle Slo!

303
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.880
What the... Uncle Slo? Slo Mobius?

304
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.580
Yeah, this one hurts me, too.

305
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.099
No-o-o-o-o-o!

306
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.420
Kind of the worst possible time to use his powers.

307
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.120
Just made the death happen slower.

308
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.640
I'll kill you!

309
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.320
_

310
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.180
_

311
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.029
_

312
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.322
_

313
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.420
Aaah!

314
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.700
So, uh, original grandson.

315
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.881
This is super weird.

316
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.740
Obviously we're, uh, both trying to kill each other.

317
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.554
Aw, jeez. Nice to meet you, I guess.

318
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.760
So, do we... should I just get this over with or... ?

319
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.580
Cool grandson.

320
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.940
Shitty grandpa.

321
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.460
Why am I wearing an eye patch?

322
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.120
And wait. Did we... did we switch shirts?

323
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.000
Yeah. Thanks for the assist.

324
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.520
Rick, we... we did it.

325
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.159
Evil Morty got him!

326
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.954
Rick? Rick!

327
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.700
All right, you two punks stay here.

328
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.631
Okay, I think I'm getting the pic...

329
00:17:28.632 --> 00:17:29.650
Ow!

330
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.280
Frying my backups, smart.

331
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.700
So you're like an evil Morty. A clever one.

332
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.139
Ow!

333
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.120
All right, never been a sidekick guy,

334
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.560
but I'm starting to see the value.

335
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.100
You want a job? We could be like Batman and Robin.

336
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.938
Eh, I don't need a Robin.

337
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.025
Okay, seriously, what is this?

338
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.060
What, are you gonna "aw-jeez" me to death?

339
00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.571
_

340
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.219
Oh, you don't want those schematics, buddy.

341
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.610
Those are for grown ups.

342
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.117
Uh-huh.

343
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.750
Oh, isn't this great? Okay, all right. I get it.

344
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.710
Oh. What?

345
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.920
Oh, shit.

346
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.940
Mm-hmm. Knock yourself out.

347
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.600
Listen, Rick to Rick, he's got the weapon plans.

348
00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.400
Buddy, nip this in the bud. He's 14.

349
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.930
What's gonna happen the next time he gets mad at Grandpa?

350
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.229
Let's do this then.

351
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.107
You're welcome, by the way.

352
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.277
I made you. I showed you infinity.

353
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.640
And what did you do with it?

354
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.150
Hang out with my grandson, raise echoes of my daughter?

355
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.370
What's your life without me?

356
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.530
Let's find out.

357
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.750
Admit it.

358
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.260
You would've been me.

359
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.540
I just walked into your garage

360
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.220
before you walked into mine!

361
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.427
But eventually you did!

362
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.971
You lived in my house!

363
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.943
What... what are you doing?

364
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.195
_

365
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.080
Pretty cool visual. You're missing it.

366
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.830
We don't have to talk. This didn't make us friends.

367
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.870
There's our guy.

368
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.420
Rick! Is it over? Is... is he... ?

369
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.000
Not exactly an "alive" amount of blood.

370
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.510
How's it feel?

371
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.180
Better? No? Exactly the same?

372
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.880
Yeah, it always does.

373
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.119
Hope you're happy with your choice.

374
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.680
- Fuck off. - I'm gonna.

375
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.522
Just don't force me to improve on the design.

376
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.340
I can end the Rick experiment any time I want.

377
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.100
Why threaten? Why not just do it?

378
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.620
Because using a weapon like this

379
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.114
doesn't get you left alone, Morty.

380
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.701
Think I want a bunch of vengeful Summers coming after me?

381
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.480
You are a little different though, Rick.

382
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.079
Maybe I can use that someday.

383
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.700
Seriously though. Fuck you.

384
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.917
Don't come after me. It won't go well.

385
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.420
Are... are you okay?

386
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.560
Yeah.

387
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.450
Phew, man, when those drones uncloaked back there,

388
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.460
I was like, "Oh, shit, this is...

389
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.140
We're fucked, we're toast!

390
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.690
âª Look on down from the bridge âª

391
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.940
âª There's still fountains âª

392
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.270
âª Down there âª

393
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:52.600
âª Look on down from the bridge âª

394
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.040
âª It's still raining âª

395
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.440
âª Up here âª

396
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:09.400
âª Everybody seems so far away from me âª

397
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:17.300
âª Everybody just wants to be free âª

398
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:24.575
âª Look away from the sky âª

399
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.900
âª It's no different âª

400
00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.780
âª When you're leaving home âª

401
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:40.959
âª I can't be the same thing to you now âª

402
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.970
âª I'm just gone âª

403
00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.974
âª Just gone âª

404
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.370
Mama, who's that man in our picture?

405
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.140
Oh, honey, that's... that's...

406
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.780
That's your father.

407
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.000
You... you don't remember your father?

408
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.160
Oh.

409
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.660
Yeah.

410
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.663
