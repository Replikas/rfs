00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.710
_

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.060
Oh! Oh! Ah!

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.670
It's the crow man!

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.200
Give it a second.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.896
Maybe he's taking it out to surrender.

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.690
He's anti-heroic. Run!

7
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.660
I don't understand.

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.110
He's only one man!

9
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.960
With the power of a thousand crows.

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.220
Oh, oh! Ooh!

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.210
Good luck.

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.640
Crows and owls have always been at war,

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.920
but why do you care?

14
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.800
- What's the point? - Here's two.

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.000
- Ha-ha! Yeah. Cool. - Morty?

16
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.600
Uh, h-hey, man!

17
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.020
Good to see you!

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.690
Y-You're, like, looking, like, into crows... still.

19
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.780
Oh, uh, two crows, you remember Morty.

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.068
Morty, two crows.

21
00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:08.720
It's good to see you, but if you'd given me more of a heads up...

22
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.360
Well, I-I was just in the neighborhood.

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.529
- I-It wasn't like... - It's just that the battle for crows

24
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.740
is kind of never-ending.

25
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.360
Huh. Right.

26
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.579
A little pointless, then, right?

27
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.020
That came out wrong, s-sounded judgy.

28
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.000
- Crowhorse. Crowhorse. - Okay.

29
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.020
- Crowhorse. Crowhorse. - Looks like...

30
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.860
looks like they're leading you to a thing.

31
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.510
- Take care, Morty. - You... You too!

32
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.960
I-I'm doing good, by the way.

33
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.800
Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt

34
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.319
you left in the fridge, but I-I told him...

35
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.290
_

36
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.220
_

37
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.600
_

38
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.860
_

39
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.150
_

40
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.200
_

41
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.350
I'm looking for... Crow Scare.

42
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.010
The scarecrow? The evil scarecrow?

43
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.450
Come on. Whoever gives him up first lives.

44
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.150
Fine, I can kill an extra asshole.

45
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.651
Helps me get my steps in.

46
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.868
_

47
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.550
Ah!

48
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.560
Ahhh!

49
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.544
- Rick! - Morty?

50
00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:49.755
Wood?! Aghhhh!

51
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.259
Uh, Morty, why are you now like 40?

52
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.549
Th-That's how long it's been, Rick.

53
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.390
Oh, uh, I guess we can have a drink together, then.

54
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.440
Do you have a rum and Coke?

55
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.470
What are you, 20?

56
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.150
Oh, bless your heart.

57
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.440
Time be goin' by, don't she?

58
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.030
That's your reaction to finding out

59
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.360
you wasted your entire life?

60
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.399
I feel okay.

61
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.109
Well... well, what about me?!

62
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.970
Whoa. Excuse us, boys.

63
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.889
You don't wanna be here for this.

64
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.029
I thought if I gave you enough space,

65
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.450
you'd outgrow this... phase.

66
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.590
Here's your drink, poser.

67
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.890
Dad got sick, you know. Stage 4.

68
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.150
You would've loved it.

69
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.600
Summer's a nurse... well, pretty much a nurse.

70
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.530
She... She married a junkie.

71
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.250
Rick, come home,

72
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.588
while we still got a little time.

73
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.420
Morty, what we had wasn't healthy.

74
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.550
And this is? Y-You've had a thousand adventures with these crows.

75
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.136
When are you gonna kill their big bad?

76
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.850
First off, the "will they/kill they" is everything to my guys.

77
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.269
And second, [BLEEP] you for trying to undermine my happiness.

78
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.290
This may be the last time you ever lay eyes on me!

79
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.187
I hope that's not true, Morty,

80
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.750
because you look like shit,

81
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.670
and this is not how I wanna remember you.

82
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.330
Now that I have his two crows,

83
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.330
nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick.

84
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.010
Don't defend him to me.

85
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.010
I don't even get what you see in him.

86
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.547
You're right.

87
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.508
We should be enjoying the time we have together.

88
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.428
Crow Rick! Oh, I-I know what this must look like, but...

89
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.430
It looks like my arch nemesis, Crow Scare,

90
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.723
and my sidekicks planning adventures together.

91
00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:25.392
You are hardly the victim here.

92
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.750
I was adventuring with these two crows

93
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.030
before you ever came along.

94
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.109
_

95
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.820
What do you mean, "using me as a rebound?"

96
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.710
You feel like I was using you as a rebound, too?

97
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.826
Well, [BLEEP], this lost all meaning.

98
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.129
I guess it could have been worse.

99
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.840
At least adventuring was just a metaphor

100
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.130
for romantic partnership, so it's not a real break-up.

101
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.970
Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other's bodies.

102
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.253
What?! Ugh! No!

103
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.050
Sounds like the man's asking for proof.

104
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.690
Let's show him, fellas!

105
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.180
- I-I asked for zero proof! - Ahh!

106
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.216
Zero proof!

107
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.170
I'm giving you free will.

108
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.150
Yah!

109
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.410
Submit to Crow Horse!

110
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.970
Whoops.

111
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.830
- Rick? - Wubba lubba dub dub!

112
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.198
- I'm back, pal! - Morty, who's at the door?

113
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.929
Wait a minute. I thought you died gruesomely?

114
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.050
- W-what the hell's going on here? - See, uh, the... the thing is, uh...

115
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.060
Can you please make Morty 14 again, Dad?

116
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.650
- This is ridiculous. - Okay, look,

117
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.710
I-I may have used an aging serum

118
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.770
to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little.

119
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.569
I kind of figured, and I totally get it, Morty,

120
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.910
I-I'm done with the two crows.

121
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.319
Like, they were super clingy and I'm ready to make this work.

122
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.610
Let's just hit the reset button.

123
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.720
Well, no, honey, not a reset, okay?

124
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.270
Tell your grandpa that you're worthy of his respect

125
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.189
and you want to be treated differently from now on.

126
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.730
I refuse to do that. I-I'm desperate to get back together.

127
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.269
- Just like his old man. - Don't worry, honey.

128
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.809
That's just Morty's middle age talking.

129
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.649
He'll be less codependent once we get more of his life

130
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.930
- in front of him again. - Uh, I'd like him to stay 40

131
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.310
so he can keep buying my friends molly.

132
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.730
I'd rather throw my vote away

133
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.448
than use it to support a flawed system.

134
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.390
Can we make our first adventure fixing this?

135
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.329
- I keep thinking about lawn care. - Okay, buddy.

136
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.769
Who sold you this shitty aging serum?

137
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.309
- What did he look like? - Just like you.

138
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.210
- I-I got it from the Citadel. - Hot damn.

139
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.290
Hittin' the ground running with a Citadel episode.

140
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.810
See ya later, masturbators.

141
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.630
Hi! I'm Citadel's new mascot, Andy,

142
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.049
because this place wouldn't be home

143
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.130
- without Ricks "Andy" Mortys. - Dumb.

144
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.557
Ooh, what happened to this place?

145
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.270
There's a Morty president now.

146
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.645
Aw, that's cute. They rebuilt. They made it nicer.

147
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.220
- They made it Glendale. - God damn, you are cantankerous.

148
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.410
Even pooping hurts now.

149
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.609
Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up.

150
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.490
Okay, so, we've got a standard Morty

151
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.550
that's been aged to... 40?

152
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.789
- Can you reverse it? - Well, if you look at it like a bone,

153
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.910
what we can do is break his age in two places,

154
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.119
remove the middle, and graft its ends back together.

155
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.910
Th-that sounds really violent.

156
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.165
- It's not a literal bone, Morty. - Oh, okay.

157
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.720
Ah, brace yourself, the process does also break every bone

158
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.990
- in your body. - Wait! Aah! Ooh! Ow!

159
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.730
- I like crayons. - Girls are gross.

160
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.345
I-I think I feel like myself again.

161
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.439
Uh, you look a little weird.

162
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.390
Your skin's all pink like a baby mouse.

163
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.890
- I-Is that normal? - Probably.

164
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.820
Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the 26 years we removed.

165
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.170
Wait, what? I ain't payin' to store 26 years.

166
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.670
Well, then you're taking it with you.

167
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.250
I'm almost ready to sell out.

168
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.362
All right, what's disposal cost?

169
00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:24.779
Oh!

170
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.073
S-something unfair's happening.

171
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.870
There's no escape. No escape!

172
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.500
Let me help you! This is not a good look.

173
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.536
Oh!

174
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.453
- Oh, boy. - Hey! They... they shot me!

175
00:07:32.454 --> 00:07:34.539
You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience.

176
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.832
- Listen to me! - Drop the gun!

177
00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.291
Death is coming for us all,

178
00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:39.670
and the Citadel is a weapon of mass des...

179
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.290
Woof. You're about to get suspended with pay.

180
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.519
Come on, Morty, let's get outta here before this gets political.

181
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.250
Oh! Was I... influential?

182
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.990
Yeah, y-you were influential.

183
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.680
Y-You had like seven... seven blogs.

184
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.017
Tight. Oh.

185
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.050
Ugh. Too late.

186
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.395
Rick C-137,

187
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.900
President Morty requests you join him for dinner.

188
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.330
Whoa! S-Seriously?

189
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.700
You know I destroyed this place.

190
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.969
You've been pardoned for that, sir.

191
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.729
Rick! Let's have dinner with the Morty President.

192
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.669
Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures.

193
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.210
- The Citadel runs on canon. - Okay.

194
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.769
I guess things really are just going right back to how they were.

195
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.330
Fine. I could eat.

196
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.664
But the second he reveals he's evil, we're gone.

197
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.230
I dunno. It tastes... pretty good.

198
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.130
Okay, let me know if you start feeling poisony.

199
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.760
Good to have you back, buddy.

200
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.924
Mmm!

201
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.830
Sorry I'm late. Never really ends around here.

202
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.930
Look at this, Morty.

203
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.489
They really did make a you the president.

204
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.890
And I hate 'em every day for it.

205
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.170
But wow! Rick C-137.

206
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.410
Now, that's a guy to move your schedule around for.

207
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.689
Not... Not here to blow the place up again, I hope.

208
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.273
Ha! Not unless you try to keep me here.

209
00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:42.930
Ha-ha, geez. Wouldn't dream of it.

210
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.159
But it's amazing you dropped by

211
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.390
because I was eventually gonna hunt you down.

212
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.130
There's the reveal. Let's dance.

213
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.690
- Ha! Geez. - Rick, come on, man.

214
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.870
The guy got elected president by Ricks and Mortys.

215
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.180
- He's being really nice. - All politicians are nice.

216
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.790
He's a hot bag of peanuts, isn't he?

217
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.870
We've been through a lot.

218
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.208
- A-And he does not like... - Serialized drama.

219
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.330
Right, no drama. Keep it episodic.

220
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.570
Ricks never look back.

221
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.350
Waste of a legend in his case.

222
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.449
- You know he practically built this place? - Wait, what?

223
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.467
And now you're running it squeaky clean, right?

224
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.779
That's why you got deformed Mortys

225
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.929
coming up through the sewer lines

226
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.471
talking about hope and change?

227
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.450
- Fair enough. - Good clapback, Rick.

228
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.919
What's the deal with that, Mister P?

229
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.370
I got a little project going on.

230
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.860
Required some hands-on labor.

231
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.170
It would require less if you were willing to tell me

232
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.810
how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve.

233
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.869
All right, time to go, Morty.

234
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.239
I want to know what he's talking about.

235
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.490
Yeah, you've come all this way.

236
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.946
Can you give me 10 more seconds?

237
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.610
Literally 10? Because now it would be 6.

238
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.000
Oh, I'm fine with that.

239
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.290
Make it 2.

240
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.750
One.

241
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.069
Like I said, would have been a big help for you to tell me,

242
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.150
but I should have everything I need from you now.

243
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.410
Let me just make sure.

244
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.876
You can't scan an entire brain over appetizers.

245
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.420
Oh, most of yours got scanned a long time ago.

246
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.640
You probably don't remember.

247
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.950
Check out season 1, episode 9, Rick Heads.

248
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.770
Excelsior!

249
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.840
- Evil Rick. - We kicked his ass!

250
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.230
"Evil Rick." I love it.

251
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.730
Smartest man in the universe,

252
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.500
with an ego so big you can just grab it like a joystick.

253
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.010
Looks complete.

254
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.009
I was afraid I'd have to kill every Rick on the Citadel

255
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.690
- to get what I needed. - You asshole! I vouched for you!

256
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.608
He only came here because I asked him to.

257
00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:08.735
I'm sorry, Rick.

258
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.440
That apology and a screwdriver in my hand

259
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.655
would be worth a screwdriver.

260
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.350
You sellout Mortys kill me.

261
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.999
I'd hate you more than the Ricks you worship

262
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.110
if there was any point.

263
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.430
But you can't help it.

264
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.830
You were bred for it.

265
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.310
Wanna see?

266
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.010
You already know Rogue Ricks used Mortys

267
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.130
to hide themselves from the Citadel.

268
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.970
But you might not know it worked so well

269
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.650
that the Citadel became its own Morty Market.

270
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.760
And I'm sure you don't know

271
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.510
how far they've gone to help supply meet demand.

272
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.470
Sure, Ricks could scour infinity

273
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.141
for naturally occurring grandsons.

274
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.510
But why bother? So much work.

275
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.353
Such an admission of need.

276
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.430
There aren't infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty.

277
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.290
He's an infinite smear of one shitty old man.

278
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.870
And he's attached to us infinitely

279
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.650
through his weakness and our forgiveness.

280
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.241
- Oh! Oh! - This is why we're with him.

281
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.970
This is why we're alive.

282
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.090
What the [BLEEP]? Rick, say this isn't true.

283
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.870
- It isn't the whole truth. - Liar!

284
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.962
- It's complicated! - I'm not busy.

285
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.560
Okay, Morty, remember when I said all I need was your apology

286
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.920
and a screwdriver in my hand?

287
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.390
Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand.

288
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.346
I mean, duh-doy. I'm basically Inspector Gadget.

289
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.389
Uh-oh.

290
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.726
It's okay. He's free to go.

291
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.510
He's the Rickest Rick. We'll never see him again.

292
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.510
Morty, when you came here for that serum,

293
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.970
did you refill this gun?

294
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.170
Yeah.

295
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.737
Oh. Ooh!

296
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.050
Holy [BLEEP]!

297
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.430
I only know one man that ever hacked my portal gun,

298
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.368
and it turned out it was evil you.

299
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.578
Yay! He's all caught up.

300
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.530
Wait. Hold it. Hold it.

301
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.585
- Who... Who's that? - Time for Big Boy. Duck!

302
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.212
Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhh!

303
00:11:51.213 --> 00:11:52.380
Does he like it?

304
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:54.800
It's a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?

305
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.927
Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh!

306
00:11:59.221 --> 00:12:01.555
Ohh! Ohhhhhh!

307
00:12:01.556 --> 00:12:05.560
Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhh!

308
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.200
Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhh!

309
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.942
Ohhhhhh!

310
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.179
Yoink!

311
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.529
You can't outrun your past, Rick.

312
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.741
Did you think my force field would be down the second time?

313
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.160
I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue.

314
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.210
Disapprove all you want.

315
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.040
Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering.

316
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.990
Tonight, I do that thing I want to do

317
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.878
with the curve thing.

318
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.770
Nobody leave. Everybody stay.

319
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.610
Nobody leave. Everybody stay.

320
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.489
Nobody leave. Everybody stay.

321
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.470
Nobody leave. Everybody stay.

322
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.899
- Aaaaaaah! - Nobody leave. Everybody stay.

323
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.070
Nobody leave. Everybody stay.

324
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.290
Nobody leave. Everybody stay.

325
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.930
In uncertain times like these,

326
00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.420
I think it's important for me to say, eat shit, [BLEEP] you.

327
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.999
The drug companies paid for me to say every word.

328
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.400
I have millions of dollars,

329
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.060
and I don't care if you live... oh, God!

330
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.150
Oh, [BLEEP]! No! Aah!

331
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.299
And I'd just like to say that prescription drugs are great,

332
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.420
and you should buy them now.

333
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.410
What's happening, Rick?

334
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.100
He hacked the entire city's portal supply.

335
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.788
Come on, there still might be one way out of here...

336
00:13:06.789 --> 00:13:08.130
out the bottom.

337
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.120
What do you think he needed from your brain?

338
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.870
I assume schematics for the Citadel's dimensional drive.

339
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.409
If he's gonna use it to blow the curve,

340
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.630
we do not want to be here.

341
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.040
What is the Central Finite Curve?

342
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.570
Q&A after our survival.

343
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.739
Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source

344
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.310
and get the [BLEEP] out of here.

345
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.312
Or not.

346
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.399
Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.

347
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.444
Ow! Oh!

348
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.450
So did you help build the Citadel?

349
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.809
Do you just lie to me about everything?

350
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.419
Can't we just sneak through the cave base?

351
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.789
We turned a new leaf, Morty. We're back to simple adventures.

352
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.810
It's not a new leaf until you tell me everything.

353
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.269
Morty, we really don't have time for this.

354
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.569
- The whole place is gonna blow. - No, I-I don't trust you.

355
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.000
I-I don't want to do this anymore

356
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.251
if I'm not gonna get straight answers from you.

357
00:13:53.252 --> 00:13:54.410
God damn it!

358
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.029
Here's my [BLEEP] downloaded brain, Morty.

359
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.130
You want to jump the shark?

360
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.090
You want to know my stupid crybaby backstory?

361
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.330
Knock yourself out. Not... not now!

362
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.350
- Boo ya, Rick. - Nice one, Morty!

363
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.488
Whoa. Dead wife?

364
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.370
Yes, now everyone can shut up about it.

365
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.570
Wow, Rick, I feel a lot better having seen all that.

366
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.190
Of course that's the case.

367
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.205
In their minds, they're the underdogs.

368
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.499
And that's how they justify this.

369
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.659
Morty, I'm not responsible

370
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.210
for every [BLEEP]-up Rick out there.

371
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.470
They literally all say that.

372
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.630
They all have that excuse.

373
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.850
It's part of their system.

374
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.269
None of them have to be responsible.

375
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.910
They're all victims of themselves.

376
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.471
Oh, it's so hard to be a genius. Couldn't you just die?

377
00:16:52.472 --> 00:16:53.699
Well, what are you doing about it?

378
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.390
Jack [BLEEP]. I'm leaving.

379
00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.602
Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is?

380
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.250
They built a wall around infinity.

381
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.070
They separated all the infinite universes

382
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.370
from all the infinite universes

383
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.484
where he's the smartest man in the universe.

384
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.240
Every version of us has spent every version

385
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.290
of all of our lives in one infinite crib

386
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.407
built around an infinite [BLEEP] baby.

387
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.890
And I'm leaving it.

388
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.490
That's what makes me evil...

389
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.730
being sick of him.

390
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.913
If you've ever been sick of him, you've been evil, too.

391
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.230
Rick, did you really leave the crows for me?

392
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.790
Or did you come back because they dumped you?

393
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.010
There you go, kid. Now you're Evil Morty, too.

394
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.650
Sooner or later we all are,

395
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.470
on this side of the curve.

396
00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:41.980
- Ah! - Ah!

397
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.609
Don't worry, Morty. We still got a way out

398
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.430
they never thought of... Operation Phoenix.

399
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.889
Doesn't that still mean, like, death?

400
00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.130
Sure, but the joke's on them,

401
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.390
'cause we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock.

402
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.220
Rerouted. Rerouted.

403
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.770
Rerouted. Rerouted.

404
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.002
Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.

405
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.343
- Oh, my [BLEEP] God! - Come on, Morty. We gotta go.

406
00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:14.471
You can come if you want.

407
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.473
Don't blame me if you don't.

408
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.790
Ugh! From where I sit, Morty,

409
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.169
that's the best deal on the table.

410
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.250
I-I don't have a real plan.

411
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.890
Thanks, pal. I-I'm glad you ignored my advice.

412
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.770
It's just as well. I lied.

413
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.238
That second seat's a toilet.

414
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.910
Oh. Super dick move.

415
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.830
But weirdly kind of cool to admit it.

416
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.203
Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let's go.

417
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.070
_

418
00:18:53.927 --> 00:18:55.387
Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas.

419
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.671
_

420
00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.750
Ooowee! Evil Morty.

421
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.250
That was quite a scheme.

422
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.910
Makes me wonder if there's an evil me out there.

423
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.180
But I guess sometimes I look at my life,

424
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.050
and I may not even need him, 'cause, well,

425
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.225
guess I've made a pretty big mess of things myself.

426
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.870
Ooowee.

427
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.050
Never got my job at the university back.

428
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.470
Remember that? Rick made me do karate.

429
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.170
It... It was kinda funny.

430
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.390
But I guess things went downhill from there.

431
00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.730
Started isolating myself from Amy.

432
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.010
Used to tell her everything I was feeling,

433
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.510
but then I guess I stopped,

434
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.090
'cause I wanted her to love who she thought I was,

435
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.190
not who I felt myself becoming.

436
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.930
Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be

437
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.910
if they found out who we truly are?

438
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.810
So we just dig ourselves deeper into our lies every day,

439
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.250
ultimately hurting the only people brave enough to love us.

440
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.910
Wish I didn't do that.

441
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.250
Wish I was brave enough to love them back.

442
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.890
I don't know. Maybe you should try it.

443
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.920
We don't have as much time as we think.

444
00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:48.309
Ooowee.

445
00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:51.437
Did you get any of that?
