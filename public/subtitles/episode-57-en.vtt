1
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.380
And in weird things in space news,

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.428
that mysterious "rift" is still there.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.480
Not gone yet. You remember that, don't you?

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.559
It's probably important.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.580
Back to you, Tabitha.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.560
Rick, Mom's working, and Dad's still sleeping.

7
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.759
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna be late.

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.771
Yeah, yeah. I-I got you.

9
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.140
- Here. - Holy shit.

10
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.660
I-Is the portal gun working again?

11
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.942
Yeah, pretty much.

12
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.340
Sometimes that happens.

13
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.784
Just get the keys.

14
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.940
It's actually been nice taking a break

15
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.260
from the portal travel stuff.

16
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.349
I-I've been racking up a lot of high-school adventures.

17
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.440
- I have a process, Morty. - Huh?

18
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.599
I'm fixing my portal gun, and every time you bring it up,

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.010
it blocks my creative flow.

20
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.100
A-And then I'm forced to take longer on purpose

21
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.569
just to train you to not bring it up.

22
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.290
Geez. Do you know what "projection" is?

23
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.790
- Do you? - No.

24
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.460
I-I-I heard Mom use it.

25
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.400
Lord, no. He's here again?

26
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.310
Morty protocol, children.

27
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.930
Oh, what's it now?

28
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.660
Brain bugs? Space worms?

29
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.148
Have I been "The Faculty'd" again?

30
00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.275
You guys don't have to react like this every day.

31
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.560
Last time, the aliens made me lick all the toilet seats.

32
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.720
That's right... made me.

33
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.260
I see that look on your faces.

34
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.910
What did you do, ya tiny monster?

35
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.940
This isn't me.

36
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.980
The people demand to know...

37
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.220
Do these visitors come in peace?

38
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.460
But first, "Peter's Pizza Corner."

39
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.440
What slice we reviewing today, Petey?

40
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.594
Cheese.

41
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.580
If these aliens want Earth,

42
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.400
they'll have to go through Egypt.

43
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.022
And they can ask mummies how that goes.

44
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.610
Mummy Mia!

45
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.035
Dinosaurs are back?

46
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.663
Monkeys went bald?

47
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.469
Shh!

48
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.940
Before we start...

49
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.450
where are the rest of... us?

50
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.180
Uh...

51
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.520
They died. Uh...

52
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.100
Long time ago.

53
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.962
Way before us. We didn't see nothin'.

54
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.716
But surely our ancestors must have left some evidence behind.

55
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.635
Why is he nervous?

56
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.580
Because, uh, you're dinosaurs.

57
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.040
It's weird.

58
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.103
Thought you were dead.

59
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.920
Moving on, we, quote, "dinosaurs" evolved here on Earth

60
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.980
until our technology was planetarily harmonic.

61
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.910
That being the goal with technology.

62
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.400
After we achieved perfect balance with Mother Earth,

63
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.200
our best and bravest left to help other planets.

64
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.580
Over millions of years,

65
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.708
we've called many worlds home and helped each one flourish.

66
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.337
Imagine our surprise upon returning home to find our species extinct

67
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.091
and Earth now in the care of... you guys.

68
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.969
When we left, you were basically squirrels.

69
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.290
Well, uh, we've come a long way,

70
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.807
and we... We've buried a lot more than nuts.

71
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.350
We've evolved past nonconstructive criticism,

72
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.479
so let's agree you've done your best.

73
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.620
You're still alive.

74
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.310
But surely there was some point between gunpowder

75
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.440
and something called Amazon Prime

76
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.720
that you folks had to think,

77
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.760
"Are we supposed to be running a planet?

78
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.290
Wouldn't we rather make... Marvel movies?"

79
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.960
How many Marvel movies have you made?

80
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.535
29, and 14 more on the way.

81
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.040
See, you love doing that.

82
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.900
And we love helping new life-forms get their footing.

83
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.750
So now that we're back, we can respectfully take it from here.

84
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.299
Now, hold on. If you've seen "Endgame,"

85
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.085
you know invasion is not something Earth takes lying down.

86
00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:17.640
This is not an invasion.

87
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.928
Besides, wouldn't you like to lie down?

88
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.013
Ugh. You must be exhausted.

89
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.350
Put your feet up, get more tattoos,

90
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.643
finish rounding out this "Ant-Man" character.

91
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.220
Think of it like your Earth concept of "vacation,"

92
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.770
- except permanent. - I think I speak for all world leaders

93
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.980
when I say that the poor people would just murder us

94
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.580
if we made you leave, so...

95
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.320
welcome home, dinosaurs.

96
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.220
Oh. I could use a vacation.

97
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.460
- Should we nuke them? - I'm on vacation, Curtis.

98
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.400
Well, you leaned into this fast.

99
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.038
_

111
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.470
Ugh. I can't even pretend to feel useful in a game.

112
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.380
This is how humanity's story ends?

113
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.708
Relieved of duty and sat at the kids' table?

114
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.200
I gotta respect these dinosaurs.

115
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.620
They dominated a whole species

116
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.088
just by calling its bluff about wanting more free time.

117
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.159
They didn't even dominate us

118
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.579
because we're not worth a fight to them.

119
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.593
We've become biological Tyler Perry movies.

120
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.669
- All they've done is help. - We didn't need their help.

121
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.860
We were not the problem.

122
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.580
This house recycles.

123
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.140
They sort it at the trash facility.

124
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.330
What the "F"? My dance videos are getting, like, zero likes now.

125
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.890
Oh, yeah. The dinos kicked pedophiles off TikTok.

126
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.370
Great. So now I'm broke?

127
00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.840
You don't need money anymore.

128
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.940
So what's this for now?

129
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.809
Phone calls? Ugh.

130
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.289
Oh, c'mon, Dad. You don't hate this, too?

131
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.440
Why would I? I-I was already doing what I wanted.

132
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.240
I do think it's kind of funny that you're all basically Jerry now.

133
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.914
Fuck.

134
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.660
Jerry, how do you do it?

135
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.418
- Yeah, Dad, how do you do it? - How do you do it, Dad?

136
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.545
- Huh? - How do you do it?

137
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.420
It's finally happened.

138
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:22.990
_

139
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.720
_

140
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.860
_

141
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.435
_

142
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.190
- _ - All right.

143
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.480
Does anyone know how to mail things to publishers?

144
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.700
Uhp.

145
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.810
President only pages me if it's an emergency

146
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.198
or he needs Molly.

147
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.260
I'm sure glad you stayed open, Beau.

148
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.957
Wish we could pay, but no more capitalism.

149
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.460
I never make ribs for the money, Mr. President.

150
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.640
Oh, um, here ya go.

151
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.100
That's not why I called.

152
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.680
Drugs can't solve this problem.

153
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.217
I can't live like this anymore.

154
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.120
At first it was fun spending all day

155
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.670
watching whatever YouTube autoplays

156
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.930
after the last one autoplayed,

157
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.340
but a man can only watch so many ads for Grammarly.

158
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.610
Rick. Please.

159
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.080
You're not bound by morality.

160
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.980
Get rid of them. Slit their necks.

161
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.289
Zero Dark Thirty these fuckers for the good of the species.

162
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.250
I won't tell. Help us go back to the old days,

163
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.235
where we pretend to fix the problems we caused.

164
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.459
You think I'm gonna side with you

165
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.760
over hyper-intelligent creatures

166
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.660
operating way beyond your comprehension?

167
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.480
I have more in common with them than you.

168
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.560
You pompous autistic cadaver!

169
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.000
You think you're above this?

170
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.579
- I ought to... - Look here, Mr. President.

171
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.130
When I need my ribs to be tender and delicious,

172
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.500
I pamper them.

173
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.003
See, if you give someone what they want,

174
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.300
they'll give you what you need.

175
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.680
- I'm jus' saying. - I see your point, Beau.

176
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.210
All right, Rick. Ha ha.

177
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.820
Name your price.

178
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.950
- Aw, crap. - God damn it.

179
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.520
How often are you "Westworld-ing" me?

180
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.800
Hang on. Rib-tips jammed his folk-chip again.

181
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.380
Ol' reliable Rick.

182
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.520
Always k-knows what to do.

183
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.569
- What do you want, Rick? - Trustworthy.

184
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.079
- I won't stoop to answering that again. - Honest.

185
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.480
You know exactly what I want.

186
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.652
I can't just snap my fingers and get you that job.

187
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.260
Yeah, yeah. Thanks for lunch.

188
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.370
Fine. Fine!

189
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.970
If you get rid of the dinosaurs...

190
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.440
you can host the Oscars.

191
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.140
- Yes! - Righteous R-Rick.

192
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.980
Straight shootin', t-truth-tellin',

193
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.580
never wets the bed.

194
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.460
Goodbye, old friends.

195
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.160
May you rest in peace,

196
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.350
rather than the tank of an S.U.V.

197
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.059
Hello, fellow cosmic voyagers.

198
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.176
Can we help you?

199
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.040
Actually, I can probably help you.

200
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.360
See, I'm technically human,

201
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.806
but I've come to be more, you know, on your level.

202
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.099
We're fine, thank you.

203
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.430
Maybe I'm being too indirect.

204
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.499
I happen to dabble in multiversal travel,

205
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.938
and I could probably zap you guys to an alternate Earth.

206
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.760
We used portal travel eons ago,

207
00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:45.460
but evolved to a one-universe,

208
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.620
one-truth policy as the highest form of existence.

209
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.630
Sort of a "put your own oxygen mask on

210
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.740
before helping others" type of a thing.

211
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.326
Have you been on a plane?

212
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.994
Yes, I've been on a plane.

213
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.880
We have no problem if you jump dimensions.

214
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.740
Although we sense your gateway device is suboptimal.

215
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.520
- Let us help. - I don't need help.

216
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.260
I-I'm here to help you.

217
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.630
What the hell is this?

218
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.020
A "Portal Pistol."

219
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.470
The gateways are see-through, not a green swirl,

220
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.240
so now you can see where you're going.

221
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.420
Clever girl.

222
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.840
If you'd like, we could patch up

223
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.515
your little interdimensional rift too.

224
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.460
No, leave it. I know how to close that.

225
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.240
That's there for a reason. Very canonical.

226
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.570
Don't you just want it closed?

227
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.979
Morty, whose team are you on?!

228
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.059
It's normal to be frustrated. Here.

229
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.659
- _ - Oh, my God, are you fucking kidding me?

230
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.940
- Goodbye. - No. Wait.

231
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.939
- What the fuuuuuck! - Ah!

232
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.539
- I saw my bones! - Dr. Manhattan high-road assholes

233
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.439
- teleporting me? - Why... Why wasn't that painful?

234
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.800
They didn't even do it right. My... My... My fly is down.

235
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.340
Your fly was already down.

236
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.490
What are you doing with that?

237
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.640
Rick, it was a better...

238
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.910
Nothing from them is better.

239
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.600
That thing had uptight Zen snob germs all over it.

240
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.039
So, what, now you're gonna fight them?

241
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.520
And prove we're violent and stupid?

242
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.420
No. We're gonna find out what they're hiding.

243
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.500
Only people who have really fucked up in the past

244
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.960
have to virtue signal this hard.

245
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.010
Look at Sean Penn.

246
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.579
But, Rick, aren't these feelings, like, what they're talking about?

247
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.310
Like, life gets, um...

248
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.480
"programmed for competition by early stages of evolution."

249
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.710
Like, amoebas have to fight amoebas for energy,

250
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.320
but once a species can get enough sugar from a machine

251
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.750
to give itself diabetes,

252
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.820
it's allowed to start thinking beyond conflict.

253
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.660
I mean, it's all in their pamphlet.

254
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.660
Morty, you're a genius.

255
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.760
I clearly mean that in the '90s ironic sense,

256
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.020
but this self-fellating zine is a treasure map

257
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.800
to every fossilized bone in their skeleton closet.

258
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.450
They're gonna call us Laura Dern

259
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.720
because we're about to get elbow deep in Dino doo-doo.

260
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.920
Get it, Morty? The gloves?

261
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.589
- You... You remember the big gloves? - Yeah, no, I get it, Rick.

262
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.790
I said "clever girl" earlier. You didn't even react.

263
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.000
I was angry.

264
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.720
Um, I'm looking for a few of my, uh, friends.

265
00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.620
Hmm. Kinda look like the Skullfeet

266
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.640
that used to live on our planet way before us.

267
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.860
- They're long gone now. - Really?

268
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.631
- They're extinct here, too? - Yeah.

269
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.940
We keep their bones in that museum over there.

270
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.110
Um, wow.

271
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.710
These guys aren't gonna be much help.

272
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.350
The leading theory is, the Skullfeet

273
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.300
stepped on their own brains so much they straight-up died.

274
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.700
Such a shame. Would have loved to hear them sing.

275
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.750
- Sing? - Yeah.

276
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.730
We figured they used to hold huge outdoor concerts

277
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.890
in their land amphitheater.

278
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.049
You people are idiots.

279
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.490
Hey. We didn't have much to go by.

280
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.000
Bones aren't big on conversation.

281
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.384
Yeah, neither are you, pal.

282
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.880
The majestic Basketsaur. Aren't they incredible?

283
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.560
We're even making a series of increasingly terrible movies

284
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.393
about cloning them in a theme park.

285
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.770
- So what happened to them? - No idea.

286
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.190
But we do know they all loved eating communal soup

287
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.940
out of the Great Dirt Bowl.

288
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.693
Starting to see a pattern here.

289
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.488
Breathtaking, aren't they?

290
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.280
It's a common misconception that they roamed our planet.

291
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.951
The truth is, they rolled.

292
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.328
Street-style mostly. Some vert.

293
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.370
Lemme guess. There's a very large, deep circular indentation

294
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.084
in which these "Grindasaurs" used to shred.

295
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.830
We think they had a second brain in their butt

296
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.700
dedicated to pulling 1080s.

297
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.540
Three planets visited by dinosaurs,

298
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.600
three apocalyptic meteor impacts.

299
00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.860
Gi... Gi... Gimme the board.

300
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.200
I'm dropping in for data.

301
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.221
Aah!

302
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.339
- Oh! - Rick! That's the hardest thing

303
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.519
- in skateboarding. - Ow!

304
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.393
It looked so easy on... aah... "Pro Skater 3."

305
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.644
Oww.

306
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.460
Hello.

307
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.600
- _ - Jackpot, Morty.

308
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.529
You still think the dinosaurs got something to hide?

309
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.500
No, Morty, they have a reason to hide.

310
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.379
- Come here, ya little whippersnapper. - No, Rick, stop!

311
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.759
- C'mere, Morty. Come on, gimme a hug. - No, don't touch me.

312
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.579
- Your hands are greasy. - What's the matter with you?

313
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.030
It's become clear your species is having a hard time

314
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.740
adjusting to its reduced accountability.

315
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.640
Our solution is to hold these regular keynotes, or talks,

316
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.180
which you used to launch new phones and religions.

317
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.174
Uhp, I see someone's eager to speak.

318
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.760
Hi. Um, what do you do when you want to kill yourself?

319
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.100
You don't do that.

320
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.320
Thank you for asking, though.

321
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.460
Ver... Very important.

322
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.268
We recently discovered a new piece of human literature

323
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.260
that we think everyone should read.

324
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.660
Holy shit! I'm a famous author!

325
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.066
Wait, where's my name?

326
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.760
We will distribute it to everyone on Earth tomorrow.

327
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.330
Excuse me. Aren't you gonna say who wrote it?

328
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.220
Nope. Whoever wrote it must be above needing credit.

329
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.060
It's all here in this book that belongs to everyone.

330
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.300
For free.

331
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.340
You Communist lizard scumbags!

332
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.940
I wrote that. Me, Jerry Smith!

333
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.250
- _ - Hey, hey, hey!

334
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.670
Guess what. Dinosaurs are not secretly evil,

335
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.600
and they're not out to cause anybody trouble,

336
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.603
but it turns out trouble has a way of following them.

337
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.980
Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's showtime.

338
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.900
Literally every planet with dinosaurs on it

339
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.140
is eventually smashed by a huge space rock

340
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.363
that takes out them and most existing life.

341
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.120
What? That can't be true.

342
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.740
It's all right to be frustrated.

343
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:45.840
Let me explain.

344
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.980
Why would planet-killing meteors follow dinosaurs?

345
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.370
As these reptiles evolved to higher and higher levels

346
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.140
of loving vegan godhood,

347
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.109
another life-form devolved into an equally selfless,

348
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:59.090
hate-filled species of barely sentient rocks.

349
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.750
They hurtle through space and do as much damage as they can

350
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.052
to their chosen enemy, which is guess who.

351
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.900
Yup, everywhere these dinos go,

352
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.760
these rocks, they come a-crashing.

353
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.270
And this one...

354
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.061
... is headed directly towards us.

355
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.770
And all of our work? It was for...

356
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.910
Nothing. Bingo. Welcome to life.

357
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.339
It's a big boat with a lot of holes,

358
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.489
but we're all in it together.

359
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.820
- Oh, my. - Ohhhhh.

360
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.680
- Mm. - So much death.

361
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.770
Congratulations, primates.

362
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.120
Looks like Earth could have done worse.

363
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.700
Rick out. Oh.

364
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.840
And don't forget to tune in to this year's Oscars.

365
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.501
Well, this is a... a lot to take in.

366
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.505
I like trains now.

367
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.400
Okay, that hurt.

368
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.134
Trains rule!

369
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.580
Dinos drool!

370
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.050
And you had no idea about the disastrous meteors

371
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.265
that followed in your wake?

372
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.040
We just learned about it like you.

373
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.726
Truly heartbreaking news.

374
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.000
But I assume you're gonna destroy it

375
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.230
when it arrives here, right?

376
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.640
Um, we're in the process of finding a solution

377
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.777
that, um, doesn't involve violence.

378
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.196
Hold on. You're in the process?!

379
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.549
Well, there you have it, Cooperheads.

380
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.080
An angry species of rock is gonna slam into our...

381
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.280
sorry... their planet, and our new planet runners

382
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.998
are weighing whether to let it happen.

383
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.240
I mean, no one knows if the meteor species is even real.

384
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.700
No. It's very real.

385
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.700
- We all know that. - You know what's real?

386
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.960
A rear naked choke hold. I'll show you.

387
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.010
- Hmm? - What?

388
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.759
Final question... How we doing?

389
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.960
We have come to the conclusion the only way

390
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.420
to ensure humanity will be safe is for us to go.

391
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.350
We are leaving the planet for good.

392
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.861
- _ - âª Exxon spilling the oil âª

393
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.400
âª Chernobyl blowing up âª

394
00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.700
- âª Asbestos in Montana âª - _

395
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.190

âª Deepwater deeply blew it âª

398
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.584
- âª Giant garbage island âª - _

399
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.330
- âª And all the bees are dying âª - _

400
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.301
- âª Fuck off and die-nosaurs âª - _

401
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.220
Maybe it's the Molly, but I fucking love you, Rick.

402
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.390
- It's the Molly. - Isn't this nice?

403
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.200
Rivalries behind us, dinos gone,

404
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.730
two cool guys living in the moment.

405
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.740
So, uh, like, uh

406
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.079
you know what you're gonna wear? Because...

407
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.740
- I can't get another plus-one. - What?!

408
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.920
I'm the one who got you the gig, you son of a bitch!

409
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.180
I feel this napkin...

410
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.020
Feel this napkin.

411
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.372
So soft.

412
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.200
This is the 95th annual Academy Awards.

413
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.340
Now, please welcome your host,

414
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.200
an old science guy who got rid of the dinosaurs...

415
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.384
Rick Sanchez.

416
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.340
Suck my gray tits, Hollywood pinkos.

417
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.430
Where's the Mic?

418
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.880
The... The... The raising Mic?

419
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.330
Ha.

420
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.811
Bring it up!

421
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.480
Tommy.

422
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.234
Tom Hanks is here.

423
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.112
C'mon. Do it.

424
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.530
Come on.

425
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.907
Do ittttt.

426
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.080
Okay, okay, one time.

427
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.160
"Wilson!"

428
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.749
I'm Oscar host Rick.

429
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.700
Grandpa Rick, this is so cool.

430
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.960
- That microphone bit killed. - Yeah, told you it would.

431
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.150
That was all scripted?

432
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.640
Every moment at the Oscars is.

433
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.080
- Even that one thing. - Ha ha!

434
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.100
Look who stole themselves a swag bag.

435
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.806
- Ah, fucking Sprinkles coupon! - We're splitting that.

436
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.040
Hey, so I was thinking it might be funny

437
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.780
to add dinosaurs to the "In Memoriam."

438
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.120
Eh, it feels beneath us.

439
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.949
It's funnier that they left and we don't even care.

440
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.180
Oh, yeah, they left, but they keep begging for attention.

441
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.250
You haven't heard?

442
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.989
The dinos are just standing up there on Mars

443
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.239
with their dicks in their hands.

444
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.405
So dramatic.

445
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.400
What, they're just gonna let the meteor hit them a-and die?

446
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.390
Good. If being superior to everyone makes you die,

447
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.060
I call that balance.

448
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.340
It's all in my globally published book

449
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.880
the dinos stripped my name from!

450
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.060
Ugggh.

451
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.940
Oscars are over. Where are my keys?

452
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.200
God damn it, I need to fix portal travel.

453
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.593
And... And I'm going to. I have a process.

454
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.870
Our final act of kindness.

455
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.184
It's been an honor serving the sanctity of life with you all.

456
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.410
Hee-aaaaaaaaarghhhhhhhhh!

457
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.590
Rick, what are you doing?

458
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.940
- Standing here with you guys. - You don't want to do that.

459
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.740
We're sacrificing ourselves here.

460
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.990
Then so am I. Y'know?

461
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.560
Elon Musk be damned, we're blowing up Mars.

462
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.860
No. We're doing something selfless.

463
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.530
You're doing it out of pettiness.

464
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.760
How is anyone supposed to know the difference?

465
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.959
Consider it a game of virtue chicken.

466
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.240
Okay, if you won't go, we'll make you go.

467
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.109
Oh. Sorry. I-I Dino-proofed my tech to spite you guys.

468
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.090
Which further proves selflessness and selfishness

469
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.540
are two sides of the same coin,

470
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.101
so what's the point?

471
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.400
Fine. Cool with me that your final chapter

472
00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.572
is dying on Mars with an old dickhead.

473
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.242
Hyaaaa!

474
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.743
Aaaah!

475
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.710
All right! Welcome back.

476
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.915
You obnoxious little twat!

477
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.940
Yeah, but you're alive.

478
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.410
No David Foster Wallace-ing in my galaxy.

479
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.580
You don't get to be so smart

480
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.380
that you remove yourself from everybody.

481
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.924
From one god being to another, you're welcome.

482
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.760
Well, as long as we're doing each other favors...

483
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.630
Hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

484
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.000
You fixed my rift? You fucking hypocritical cocks.

485
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.460
I-It was all canonical and shit.

486
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.409
We coulda milked that thing for a whole season.

487
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.100
O-Or, like, a three-episode arc at least.

488
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.410
Sorry. That's just us.

489
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.720
We love helping,

490
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.720
god beings to god being.

491
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.576
Seriously. I was gonna fix that.

492
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.700
Shit. They're coming back.

493
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.150
Can we turn on the A.C.?

494
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.380
It's, like, a thousand degrees outside.

495
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.790
Yes! New follower.

496
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.530
Named... CryptoForBareToes?

497
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.760
Not sure I get it, but sounds like business.

498
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.800
- Proud of you, honey. - Is Dad okay?

499
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.807
Yes. I'm just... writing my second book.

500
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.069
I don't know what it's gonna be about,

501
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.420
but I can tell you one thing...

502
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.740
The title is "Jerry Smith Presents:

503
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.440
A Book by Jerry Smith."

504
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.620
Chapter one...

505
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.300
Fuck!

506
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.450
Morty, get your ass in the garage!

507
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.700
Hoo-ha! Check it out.

508
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.980
A... A dimension where hats wear people.

509
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.950
Mmmmm! Oh!

510
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.629
I did it! I fixed portal travel.

511
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.730
- Oh, shit. - Figured my guy deserves a vacation.

512
00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.060
- Boob World! - You're damn right.

513
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.740
- And it's Areola Week. - All right!

514
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.400
Good old-fashioned portal fun.

515
00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.629
Yep. Like this.

516
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.640
Ohh! Whoa!

517
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.849
- It's gonna be classic episodes, Morty. - Oh, I'm gonna puke, Rick!

518
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.420
Portaling in. Wrecking shit, portaling out, Morty.

519
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.980
Oh, my Go... Adventures, Morty.

520
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.219
- Aah! Aah! - Social commentary.

521
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.290
Crude characters. Here we go.

522
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.059
Rick and Morty time!

523
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.640
This is our home now.

524
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.720
We shall live out the rest of our days here.

525
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.648
Never interfering with the ways of the universe again.

526
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.160
We are content.

527
00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.520
It was a good run.

528
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.278
Speaking of a good run...

529
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.120
I bet I could switch heel onto that Manny pad,

530
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.480
big spinout, tre flip that gap, 5-0 the rail,

531
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.492
drop into the bowl, stalefish into a Christ Air,

532
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.900
and then we get fucking wrecked.

533
00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.670
