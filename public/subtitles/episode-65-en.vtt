00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.480
Who's ready for Rick's famous spaghetti?!

2
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.920
I love Spaghetti Thursdays!

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.517
Oh, my God, Rick, i-it's like it's better every time!

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.640
Hell yeah, you like that?!

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.360
That's-a some good spaghetti!

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.689
Grandpa Rick, I'm skull emoji but words.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.000
Sauce? More sauce? Oh, we gots the sauce!

8
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.659
Dad, you... you had a job interview, right?

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.820
Bombed it!

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.530
But it's nothing a little Bolognese won't cure!

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.740
Dad, this noodle is sooo tender.

12
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.200
A little spicy! A little sweet!

13
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.827
A little spicy! A little sweet!

14
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.459
It's so nice that we're talking, you know,

15
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.520
all... all... all talking

16
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.899
because we're a family and everything,

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.860
and this a good time we're having.

18
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.580
- Is there any more?! - Seconds? Thirds?

19
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.300
We spa-gots as much as you can spag-eat!

20
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.670
Rick, I-I got to know, like,

21
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.340
wh-what's the secret ingredient...

22
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680
God, no! Why? Why? No!

23
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.340
Why is it always this shit with you?!

24
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.050
O-Of course it's a person!

25
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.050
Rick, why couldn't it just be spaghetti?

26
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.069
I'm just going to say this as simply as possible

27
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.386
and let you not believe me...

28
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.120
on this planet, people that kill themselves turn into spaghetti.

29
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.420
- What? - I know, you're a visual learner,

30
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.460
so follow me.

31
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.260
Oh, hi, Doctor Hotpenis.

32
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.819
You're not supposed to bring patients...

33
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.340
Hi, Michael. It's okay.

34
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.500
This alien boy has space cancer,

35
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.540
and his dying wish is to see deader people

36
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.150
- so he can feel superior. - All you had to say.

37
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.820
Check it out. Murdered.

38
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.080
Oh, gross!

39
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.140
- Car crash. - Oh!

40
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.080
And suicide.

41
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.960
Ugh, Rick, I don't...

42
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.959
Wait, what is that smell?

43
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.720
You know God damn well what it is, baby.

44
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.650
- Get in here. - Oh, don't do that!

45
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.719
You've been doing it for weeks every spaghetti night!

46
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.200
Come on, Morty. Choo choo plane!

47
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.540
- Gross! - Come on!

48
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.720
God damn!

49
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.800
- Telling you! - Why?! How?!

50
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.780
Their cortisol increases the starch content

51
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.559
in their bloodstream, changing their intestines

52
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.060
into one long spaghetti noodle,

53
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.740
and the surrounding tissues into a spicy-sweet hematoma

54
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.540
that we would call a Bolognese.

55
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.540
But it takes a lot of cortisol...

56
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.020
like a suicidal amount.

57
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.400
I-It's almost better cold!

58
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.120
Wouldn't go that far, don't be a hipster.

59
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.470
Excuse me. Are you two eating a corpse?

60
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.080
It's okay! I-It's spaghetti.

61
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.359
Morty, they don't know what that is.

62
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.500
I'm calling the police!

63
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.700
- Before you do that, just... - No, Rick, stop...

64
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.020
What?! Where am I?

65
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.000
- In a morgue, eating bodies! - We're what?!

66
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.200
- Stop using that thing! - What thing? Who are we?

67
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.630
- We were just leaving. - All you had to say!

68
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.560
Whose car is this? Whose sun visor is this?

69
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.220
What's a sun?

70
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.346
Jesus, sorry, that's always embarrassing.

71
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.680
But you see what I mean now? Best spaghetti in the galaxy

72
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.160
and it's 100% guilt-free.

73
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.810
- I wanna know their names. - Who?

74
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.320
Michael? Coroner Number One?

75
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.500
The people we've been eating every spaghetti night!

76
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.619
Do you even know their names?

77
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920
I'm not giving you your spaghettises' names!

78
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.140
You've found my line, Morty! I-I find that ghoulish!

79
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.100
I-I want their names o-or I'm telling Mom

80
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.380
and no more spaghetti night!

81
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.760
You suck! Where's the thing?

82
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.500
- Where's the "Men in Black" thing? - Names!

83
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.799
And if you know the fuckin' names

84
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.060
of your spaghettis, that's it?

85
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.390
- This is done? - It's all I ask!

86
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.159
You won't get overwhelmed with even more guilt

87
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.719
and then demand to go to their fuckin' funeral?

88
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.440
Just their names and then I'm done.

89
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.930
I promise.

90
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.298
I fucking hate you.

91
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.040
I just want to pay my respects!

92
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.730
The only reason you're still alive

93
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.210
is because you don't turn delicious when you die.

94
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.180
Thank you for that moment of silence.

95
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.500
I'd like to open it up to the congregation,

96
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.733
if anyone would like to say a few words about Lawrence.

97
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.450
Or... another moment of silence.

98
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.640
Geez, no wonder he killed himself.

99
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.130
Okay, let's...

100
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.163
Oh, for...

101
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.081
Hi. Um...

102
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.834
I just want to be honest about something.

103
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.420
After Lawrence died,

104
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.240
we, uh, ate him.

105
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.980
Wait, we're not...

106
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.210
werewolves or... or anything, we... we come from a planet,

107
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.720
where, to us, when you guys kill yourselves,

108
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.590
you turn into what my planet considers food.

109
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.644
Spaghetti. It brought us together.

110
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.060
Lawrence brought us together.

111
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.900
It just felt wrong not having anyone know that.

112
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.520
But he was delicious.

113
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.030
I-I hope that helps make it right.

114
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.460
That should do it, buddy.

115
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.400
Everybody enjoy your closure.

116
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.980
So we were eating... people.

117
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.520
I-I'm afraid so.

118
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.380
They were so... spaghettiesque.

119
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.002
Yes, they were.

120
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.320
It's going to be... hard to...

121
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.900
Hard to put out of your mind, yes,

122
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.634
which is why I thought it best to keep you all in the dark.

123
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.250
So... Morty ruined spaghetti night.

124
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.100
- Correct. - Summer! It was people!

125
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.765
It was people, Summer.

126
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.359
Which is disgusting.

127
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.352
And not cool to lie about.

128
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.590
Correct.

129
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.780
But it should also be noted, to Morty,

130
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.200
that it's not cool to tattle.

131
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.770
- Dad! - They were delicious!

132
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.800
- So keep eating them! - We can't now!

133
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.862
Because of you!

134
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.300
Sorry, Morty.

135
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.080
That was terrible parenting.

136
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.100
You did the "right" thing.

137
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.454
We are technically very happy to be better informed.

138
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.000
First octopus, now this.

139
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.689
Have... Have we thought about just giving up

140
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.399
and joining the fascist half of the country?

141
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.628
- No! - Just saying, they get to do more.

142
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.220
Well, I guess I'll go to my room since everyone hates me now.

143
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.218
Oh. Sorry.

144
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.300
Good night, Morty.

145
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.980
Hey, big boy. Are you depressed?

146
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.101
Oooooh, Mama likes depression.

147
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.220
Oopsie, I spilled my milk.

148
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.680
Now, we're both sad.

149
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.066
I'm a bad family therapist farm girl.

150
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.690
Hello, Morty Smith.

151
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.531
You are invited to 41-Kepler B.

152
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.920
You know it as Spaghetti Planet.

153
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.150
You're not in trouble.

154
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.660
We just want to talk.

155
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.300
Can that thing support my weight?

156
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.980
It should.

157
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.820
Uh, o-okay...

158
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.110
um... up here?

159
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.220
Oh, uh, geez.

160
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.350
Ever heard of a ramp?

161
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.430
- This is a ramp. - Uh-huh.

162
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.780
Hi, Morty, I'm the president of this planet.

163
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.740
I saw the video of you at that funeral.

164
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.400
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

165
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.780
It was quite the... revelation.

166
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.396
Uh, would you... mind... showing us?

167
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.780
Uh, this is the... "spaghetti"

168
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.060
of a person that took their own life.

169
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.420
They did consent to be eaten.

170
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.260
Uh, okay.

171
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.440
Wow, yeah, a-amazing as always.

172
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.480
N-Not gonna lie.

173
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.130
And would you consider yourself a typical Earthian?

174
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.820
Well, on Earth, it's considered inferior to be typical,

175
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.250
so we're all very special and different,

176
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.340
but we definitely all do like spaghetti.

177
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.380
- All... eight billion of you? - Oooh.

178
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.260
Morty, how would you feel about being a kind of...

179
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.500
- ambassador? - A liaison between our worlds.

180
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.490
Oh. Now hold on.

181
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.230
I-I went to that funeral because...

182
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.800
Because you felt bad.

183
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.760
Because you didn't have permission.

184
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.234
Show him.

185
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.020
My name is Tanya Radcliffe.

186
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.780
I've been living in pain for years,

187
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.180
I've lost all my loved ones,

188
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.930
I've got nothing.

189
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.000
So when doctors told me I could finally have the "right to die"

190
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.480
if I agree to be dinner for some alien boy,

191
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.720
I simply said, "I hope I'm delicious."

192
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.160
God damn.

193
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.520
Mm, and would you say that makes it taste better?

194
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.800
It makes it go down a lot easier.

195
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.580
Oh, I like that.

196
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.340
Maybe it's time we allow some people the right to die

197
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.810
and be delicious.

198
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.840
Please feel free to finish Tanya.

199
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.910
It is what she wanted.

200
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.820
No. No, I-I-I think I'm good.

201
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.860
Thanks.

202
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.000
Tanya, you really were tasty.

203
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.284
Actually, can I take her to go?

204
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.703
Who's ready for more ethical spaghetti?!

205
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.750
Me! I love this ethical shit!

206
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.660
Full admission, I was fine before too!

207
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.270
God, this is so good!

208
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.335
- Pass the parmeesian! - Where's Dad?

209
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.180
Why does he keep missing spaghetti night?

210
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.470
I guess he got butthurt because Morty high-roaded him

211
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.170
and got us the delicious spaghetti

212
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.760
without all the lies and nihilism.

213
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.020
And another cheer for the added bonus of no Rick...

214
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.660
Boom. Sorry to interrupt

215
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.400
Morty's perfect spaghetti night,

216
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.619
but thought he'd wanna see this.

217
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.140
Whoa, what the fuck is that?!

218
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.630
"Morty-O's Suicide Spaghetti is 100% ethical,

219
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.316
single-origin pasta."

220
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.540
Oh, dear God.

221
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.520
Lemme guess, you went back to the planet,

222
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.700
gave some thoughtful insight to their leader,

223
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.020
and now they're selling their dead at every Space Walmart.

224
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.743
I-I did, but I didn't say to do this!

225
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.660
Is this people, or not people?

226
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.450
I-I just need to know how much I should pretend to be upset.

227
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.083
This seems to be Roger.

228
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.340
Hi. I'm Roger Wayne Marder.

229
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.960
I was a serial killer and cannibal,

230
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.140
and now I get to kill myself and be food for you,

231
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.000
which I suppose is a silver lining to all my misdeeds.

232
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.380
Anyway, please enjoy me.

233
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.100
So "yes" to people?

234
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.780
Wow. I-I mean, on the bright side,

235
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.260
I-I feel like one could look at this

236
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.880
as a really nice epilogue t-to a story about telling the truth.

237
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.690
Uh-huh, care to see that epilogue?

238
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.760
What is all this?

239
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.700
Cans of spaghetti selling out to every neighbouring planet.

240
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.908
Wanna go see how ethical it is down there?

241
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.160
This is Spaghetti Planet? What happened?

242
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.200
You happened.

243
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.900
You happened all over those billboards.

244
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.900
- Oh, geez, oh, no. - _

245
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.088
See that? They call that bridge "The Most Scenic Jump."

246
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.640
There used to be safety rails.

247
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.592
They melted them down for giant spaghetti strainers.

248
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.070
You wanna turn on the radio?

249
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.620
I get it, it's all Enya.

250
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.340
Nope, all morning zoo teams.

251
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.266
Just patter. No songs.

252
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.660
Oh, and for TV?

253
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.850
Wall-to-wall reality television, but not the good kind.

254
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.981
It's like their whole planet was bought by Discovery.

255
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.850
Jesus Christ, this is depressing.

256
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.640
That's definitely what they're going for.

257
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.652
Look at this shit.

258
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.113
They dyed their sun institutional gray.

259
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.290
That's not easy, kind of impressed.

260
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.600
And all of it is thanks to...

261
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.030
Oh, God.

262
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.860
I'm a murderer.

263
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.000
Oh, no, Morty.

264
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.530
What you did was much more indirect.

265
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.086
I understand your concerns, but look around.

266
00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.430
With what's coming in from intergalactic spaghetti trade,

267
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.384
we've decreased our debt, are making a lot of money.

268
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.470
We've got clean energy.

269
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.489
That space where you paused

270
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.182
is where you should have said "mental healthcare."

271
00:10:40.183 --> 00:10:43.400
All right, we had to put our fingers on the scale, a little.

272
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.040
But if we stop this, the supply chain crumbles

273
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.940
and kills the global economy.

274
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.025
How many people will suffer then?

275
00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:53.800
Okay, tough problem, definitely a spicy meat-a-ball.

276
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.500
Bu-Bu-But we can fix it. Right, Rick?

277
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.340
You mean me. You want me to fix it.

278
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.820
Uh, a moment?

279
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.200
Yes, I want you to fix it. None of this would have happened

280
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.919
if you'd been honest about the spaghetti.

281
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.280
Morty, I lied to protect you.

282
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.770
You told the truth to hurt me.

283
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.160
I can't travel the galaxy with you

284
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.969
if every time we come near a fucked up system,

285
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.087
you leap into its wires and electrocute yourself.

286
00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:12.830
I promise to stop.

287
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.300
- You what? - If you help me,

288
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.689
I-I promise I'll never look under the curtain at a Rick thing

289
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.540
to figure out what's bad about it ever again.

290
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.420
And you can never say no to me.

291
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.680
What are you, Keith Raniere?

292
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.766
- For two weeks. - Fine.

293
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.740
My grandson kissed my ass, so I'm in.

294
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.840
Okay, so, w-we just need to figure out something else

295
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.850
besides people to put in the cans, right?

296
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.020
But people are the spaghetti, that's the whole thing.

297
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.899
But what if they weren't?

298
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.310
- I'm listening. - Me, too.

299
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.999
I mean, what if we make something like a person?

300
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.740
Like... Rick, y-you're always doing clones, right?

301
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.160
What are you suggesting here?

302
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.580
A sped-up lifespan and indoctrination program?

303
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.999
Limiting their exposure to the world

304
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.380
and convincing them that becoming spaghetti is their destiny?

305
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.757
_

306
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.080
I won't be delicious for them!

307
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.680
I love you, Clone-5617B!

308
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.320
That was some speed run of "Never Let Me Go," huh?

309
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.599
Spoilers, Rick!

310
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.020
Eh, I guess all clone stories turn out the same way.

311
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.760
So, we're back to the regular people, regular suicides?

312
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.140
No, no, hold on, hold on. We can do this.

313
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.220
Maybe we make them less... people.

314
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.040
H-How much of a people do they have to be to become spaghetti?

315
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.560
Oooooh, grey areas!

316
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.740
My specialty!

317
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.083
Subject one.

318
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.680
No frontal lobe, no empathy centers.

319
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.880
Otherwise the same physiology as a person.

320
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.000
Unfortunately, to this guy,

321
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.080
there's no difference between life and death.

322
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.920
So no spaghetti.

323
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.000
Then there's this one.

324
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.690
It's in horrible, unimaginable pain from the moment it's born.

325
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.440
Oh, geez, oh, no, Rick!

326
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.520
And so I didn't even bother to make it

327
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.980
because I knew you'd take issue.

328
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.239
Even though you'd be doing it a favour

329
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.680
- by ending its life. - Fuck you.

330
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.249
You might want to examine that Trolley Problem

331
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.400
at some point, Morty.

332
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.940
Anyway, here's the last one.

333
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.340
Kept the brain stem, internal motor functions.

334
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.840
But essentially just a headless, boneless torso.

335
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.780
There's... spaghetti inside that?

336
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.140
Theoretically, yes.

337
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.100
The problem is the... y-you know.

338
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.620
Cou-Could you, um, like...

339
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.040
What is that? Wh-What are you... Is this charades?

340
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.798
Okay, okay, are you making a fist?

341
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.730
W-Wait, is that supposed to be a phone?

342
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.520
Ah, fuck it, just spell it out for me.

343
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.440
Um, maybe give them a claw-like hand

344
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.209
so they can, ya know, stab themselves to death?

345
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.436
All you had to say.

346
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.273
Well, this is some solution you guys have cooked up.

347
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.260
Spaghetti!

348
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.133
- Technically. - Good enough for me.

349
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.780
We need to fill 100,000 cans by the weekend.

350
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.360
So let's fire up these chunky boys!

351
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.100
Torso's rights! Torso's rights!

352
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.740
The new spaghetti sucks! We want authentic spaghetti!

353
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.800
- Oh, were you... - Wait, you're gonna blow yourself up?

354
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.670
Yeah, but if you wanna do it...

355
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.860
Well, you clearly have a morally superior position,

356
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.150
so please, go ahead.

357
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.460
You just want me to kill myself

358
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.030
so you can eat the spaghetti, right?

359
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.621
Fuckin' alien piece of shit.

360
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.940
- Oh, fuck you! - Fuck you!

361
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.040
How long does a society take to collapse?

362
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.379
Let's find out.

363
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.060
Ay! What's the fuckin' hold-up?

364
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.350
I've got an entire planet waiting on delivery!

365
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.800
They say they're out of spaghetti!

366
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.420
Then let's go down there and make some!

367
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.679
- Kill yourself. - Kill yourself.

368
00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.099
- Kill yourself. - Kill yourself.

369
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.359
- Kill yourself. - Kill yourself.

370
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.579
- Kill yourself. - Kill yourself.

371
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.120
- Kill yourself. - Kill yourself...

372
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.612
I understand.

373
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.800
Divert half of the armed patrols to civil unrest,

374
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.700
the other half to planetary defence.

375
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.453
Take every action necessary to restore order.

376
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.749
Still didn't hear much diverting towards mental healthcare...

377
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.900
The brainstorming is over,

378
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.780
you ghoulish little corpse-eating alien!

379
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.140
You've helped enough!

380
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.169
Fuck!

381
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.840
We owe so much spaghetti to so many planets

382
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.459
that we're all going to have to kill ourselves.

383
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.600
Slow down, slow down.

384
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.240
Rick can synthesize anything he gets a sample of.

385
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.780
Can't we still try that?

386
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.570
I mean, is there anyone else left

387
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.141
who might wanna kill themselves?

388
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.260
There's one, but good luck.

389
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.580
Two months to live.

390
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.620
Bedridden, terrible pain.

391
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.660
Whoa.

392
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.901
Why hasn't he done it yet?

393
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.960
- Hey! - Fuck you, spaghetti child!

394
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.520
- What gives?! - I'm in pain

395
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.140
and I wish I could die,

396
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.240
but I won't feed your sick system of profit.

397
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.760
Integrity means living with pain.

398
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.020
What if I told you this would end the spaghetti trade forever?

399
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.836
- What do you mean? - I'll explain on the way.

400
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.780
Did you have a, like a...

401
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.889
euthanasia chamber ready to go?

402
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.160
It's just a place.

403
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.680
Hey! Hey! Everyone stop! Stop!

404
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.107
I have a solution to get you all spaghetti.

405
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.360
We're gonna do this one last time.

406
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.280
This guy here, he's gonna do the deed,

407
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.860
and I-I'll synthesize it.

408
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.280
This is the Kitty Hawk of our Wright Brothers flight,

409
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.510
or the fill-in-the-blank from your fill-in-the-planet.

410
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.820
Now, Fred, just think about your life.

411
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.700
This machine will put it on screen for everyone to see.

412
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.750
When you're ready, press the button.

413
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.460
D-Do you think this is gonna work?

414
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.509
Trust me.

415
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.700
âª Maybe âª

416
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.820
âª I don't really wanna know âª

417
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.660
âª How your garden grows âª

418
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.920
âª 'Cause I just wanna fly âª

419
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.980
âª Lately âª

420
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.100
âª Did you ever feel the pain âª

421
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.740
âª In the morning rain âª

422
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.900
âª As it soaks you to the bone? âª

423
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.740
âª Maybe I just wanna fly âª

424
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.500
âª Wanna live, I don't wanna die âª

425
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.320
âª Maybe I just wanna breathe âª

426
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.080
âª Maybe I just don't believe âª

427
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.980
âª Maybe you're the same as me âª

428
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.820
âª We see things they'll never see âª

429
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:56.680
âª You and I are gonna live forever âª

430
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.860
âª I said maybe âª

431
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.640
âª I don't really wanna know âª

432
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.640
âª How your garden grows âª

433
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.673
âª 'Cause I just wanna fly âª

434
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.080
âª Lately âª

435
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.050
âª Did you ever feel the pain âª

436
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.780
âª In the morning rain âª

437
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.340
âª As it soaks you to the bone? âª

438
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.780
âª Maybe I will never be âª

439
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.520
âª All the things that I wanna be âª

440
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.340
âª Now is not the time to cry âª

441
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.220
âª Now's the time to find out why âª

442
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.960
âª I think you're the same as me âª

443
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.800
âª We see things they'll never see âª

444
00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.040
âª You and I are gonna live forever âª

445
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:50.010
âª Maybe âª

446
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.850
âª I don't really wanna know âª

447
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.740
âª How your garden grows âª

448
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.930
âª 'Cause I just wanna fly âª

âª Lately âª

450
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.185
âª Did you ever feel the pain âª

451
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.860
âª In the morning rain âª

452
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.820
âª As it soaks you to the bone? âª

453
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.760
âª Maybe I just wanna fly âª

454
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.500
âª Wanna live, I don't wanna die âª

455
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.380
âª Maybe I just wanna breathe âª

âª You and I are gonna live forever âª

460
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.660
âª Gonna live forever âª

461
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.560
Bon appÃ©tit.

462
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.020
Well, fuck.

463
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.330
I think I can speak on behalf of my people...

464
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.511
We've had enough spaghetti.

465
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.360
You did it, didn't you?

466
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.260
You couldn't change everyone's taste buds,

467
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.477
but you could make it... distasteful.

468
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.860
It wasn't the death, was it?

469
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.360
It was the complexity of life.

470
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.700
God, what was the point?

471
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.420
If you're asking whether this was a story about right and wrong,

472
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.040
the answer is I don't care.

473
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.160
- So what do we do? - Cells consume, Morty.

474
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.920
Life itself is wrong, and that means death is right.

475
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.500
But you can't side with that.

476
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.280
So you live, even when it means eating.

477
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.880
And Fred here really did it well.

478
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.260
Mmm, mmm.

479
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.340
The hell is this? Where is the spaghetti?

480
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.869
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Summer?

481
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.469
- What? - What's wrong with Salisbury steaks?

482
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.560
- At least try them. - Holy shit, this is...

483
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.640
the best Salisbury steak I've ever had.

484
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.260
- Mmm! - Is it actually Salisbury steak?

485
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.780
Do you want to know or not?

486
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.320
No, thanks!

487
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.980
- Just so you know, it's really bad. - Whatever you say!

488
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.790
Seriously, haha, I'm not kidding.

489
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.460
I won't tell you, but I need you to know the truth is horrible

490
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.980
so that if you ever find out on accident, you can't blame me!

491
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.034
- Now that's a deal! - Yeah!

492
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.799
Honestly, if you knew, you might kill yourselves.

493
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.259
That's the last thing I'll say forever.

494
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.300
Good!

495
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.159
âª Gonna live forever âª

496
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.820
That's where vacuum cleaner bags come from?!

497
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.100
Oh, my God.

498
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.090
Vrrrrrr!

499
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.760
Vrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

500
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.013
Hgggggg-vvrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
