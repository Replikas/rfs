1
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.630
Wait, what's that?

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.130
Do I hear something coming down the chimney?

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.220
Rick Santa-chez here with gifts from across the multiverse!

4
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.240
- Oh, my God! - Yes!

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.160
For Jerry, an extradimensional version

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.680
- of "Miracle on 34th Street." - Two hours longer!

7
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.777
They fixed my only problem with it!

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.020
For Beth, a framed photo of the two of us

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.220
from a universe where she wasn't murdered as a child.

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.440
Oh, my God. Dad.

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.230
And for Space Beth, the same thing

12
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.189
because we... we don't know which one of you is real.

13
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.120
I am also touched.

14
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.456
Summer, c-check your Venmo.

15
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.620
Ah! Money? How did you know?

16
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.740
You're 17.

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.940
And last but not least,

18
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.420
for my number one number two.

19
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.670
Morty, you asked for this a long, long time ago

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.140
and I finally went far, far away enough to get it

21
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.469
since shipping would have killed me.

22
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.320
- You didn't! No fucking way. - No fucking way.

23
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.460
Does it make the noises?

24
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.980
Of course it "makes the noises." That's like half the fun.

25
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.360
- Ha ha! Awesome! - Whoa, do not turn that on!

26
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.350
Don't worry. Morty's only gonna use this very honorable weapon

27
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.140
in designated Jedi zones... like the garage right now!

28
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.540
Ah! Ohhhh!

29
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.630
Holy crap!

30
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300
I hate to say it, but I wish there was something to attack.

31
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.580
Yeah, it's too bad nobody bought a cart of fruit!

32
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.630
You beautiful son of a bitch!

33
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.080
Grapefruit! Mango!

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.750
Papaya! Watermelon!

35
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.712
A second papaya! Another watermelon!

36
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.080
- Strike me down. - What?

37
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.260
- Strike me down! - I'm not striking you down.

38
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.280
Strike me down, Morty!

39
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.560
I-I'll become a pile of clothes like that old guy!

40
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.940
But you'll die. You're drunk.

41
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.139
- Here, I'll... I'll do it myself. - No!

42
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.330
Ha ha, wow, you did it! Just like Obi-Wan.

43
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.890
Rick? Y-You can come out now.

44
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.620
I'm serious. Did you, like, become your clothes?

45
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.983
- Are you T-shirt Rick now? - Psst. Over here, buttfart.

46
00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.850
- Hoo, that was awesome! - Right?!

47
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.660
Rick, you know, y-y-you've been so great the last couple months.

48
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.040
The family's so happy. I'm... I'm really grateful.

49
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.660
Aw, thanks, kid, but less talk, more melon slinging!

50
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.360
- Heads up! - Whoops!

51
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.599
- Oh, shit, shit, shit. Open it, Rick! - Let me do it!

52
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.520
- Get up. Get... Fucking move! - Hurry!

53
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.460
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

54
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.280
You dropped it perfectly vertical, Morty!

55
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.880
P-Perfectly fucking vertical!

56
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.471
- I got it, I got it! Aww! - Ah, shoot.

57
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.290
- Shit. - Elevator! Elevator!

58
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.200
We gotta get ahead of it! L-Level 10?

59
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.660
No, no, no! 15!

60
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.300
Wait, we live over a cool sushi spot?

61
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.360
Domo, domo. Not now, though.

62
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.740
Okay, we overshot it. Good problem to have.

63
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.810
Still doing the eel roll?

64
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.340
- I told you we should've gone to 10! - No, Morty, not 10!

65
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.559
Morty, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

66
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.640
Let me out.

67
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.083
What the fuck?

68
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.940
- Rick?! - You dumb fucking robot.

69
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.339
You had one job!

70
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.799
Hey, that job was to be a good grandpa,

71
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.980
- I-I go where the kid goes. - Don't touch me!

72
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.640
How long have I... you said you weren't a robot!

73
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.150
It killed me to lie to you, Morty.

74
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.520
But it would have literally killed me not to lie to you.

75
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.268
Betrayal! Betrayal on all sides!

76
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.410
Don't overreact, Morty.

77
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.190
I-I replaced myself towards the beginning

78
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.950
of that whole Knights of the Sun thing.

79
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.200
I-I'm no good to anybody

80
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.067
until I resolve this archnemesis crap.

81
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.153
You're still hunting the guy who killed your wife?

82
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.580
You don't have to rub it in, Morty.

83
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.360
T-That's why I removed myself.

84
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.750
I've become the thing I hate.

85
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520
I-It's like a Netflix drama down here,

86
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.179
and I don't mean an accidentally good one,

87
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.120
I mean a regular-ass Netflix drama.

88
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.440
I did you a favor.

89
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.087
Y-You gave him a fuckin' lightsaber for Christmas?!

90
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.820
It's almost like someone designed me

91
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.790
to be 22% more thoughtful than you.

92
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.009
All right, that's it, I'm shutting you down.

93
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.930
Don't you dare. Y-You've done enough.

94
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.950
The whole family, Rick.

95
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.660
- Everybody loves... this thing. - Oh, good.

96
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.609
By the way, your lightsaber's probably run out of sub-basement by now,

97
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.480
- so, congrats. - Unbelievable.

98
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.179
I can't believe you tricked us into loving you!

99
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.740
Not because I like it. It's because it's my job.

100
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.660
But thank God I don't have to do it anymore.

101
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.640
The fuck you don't. It's Christmas!

102
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.865
Get up there and trick everyone into loving you more!

103
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.340
- Let's get our "Miracle" on. - Speaking of miracles...

104
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.180
What, bored of your toy already?

105
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.860
Just, uh, excited to spend time with my family.

106
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.414
Y-You know me and Morty. We're all about those streets.

107
00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:13.360
- _ - Oh, would you look at this!

108
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.390
New York City!

109
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.720
Wow, who would have thought it had so many streets?

110
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.620
And avenues too. Oh, gosh!

111
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.840
Hey, sir, sir.

112
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.109
Have you seen any miracles?

113
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.388
My little girl, she's sick and she needs a miracle.

114
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.630
The presidential Black Hawk is landing on the lawn.

115
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.643
I'll get rid of him.

116
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.340
You got something to tell me, Morty?

117
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.731
Merry Christmas?

118
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.234
Who dropped a lightsaber perfectly fucking vertical?

119
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.700
- Oh, sh... - Guess what, numb nuts.

120
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.330
It's a mile deep and still going.

121
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.839
You know what's in the hilt of that thing?

122
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.000
- Kyber crystals! - Okay, nerd.

123
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.900
Whatever it is, when it hits the core,

124
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.179
it's gonna cause a chain reaction

125
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.372
- that destroys the Earth! - I-It is?

126
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.359
Why are you still playing with laser swords anyway?

127
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.500
You're 14!

128
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.540
You know all that Star Wars shit is silly, right?

129
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.540
Lucas promised a new trilogy for decades.

130
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.480
Then, when he delivered, fans turned on him

131
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.900
and started giving any knucklehead with nerd cred a shot

132
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.100
and churned out these irredeemable cash grabs.

133
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.580
Half pretend to be satisfied,

134
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.265
half shit on it, and in the end no one's happy.

135
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.340
Do you know why, Morty?

136
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.300
Because when you start with a turd,

137
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.560
you end with a turd.

138
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.730
Why you crying? Where's Rick?

139
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.600
He's busy. A-And I hate him.

140
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.430
And I lost my lightsaber, and now it might destroy Earth

141
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.460
and you're unloading all this Gen X hatred on me

142
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.020
for even wanting one, and i-it's the worst Christmas ever!

143
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.780
Okay, M-Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty.

144
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.929
I shouldn't have talked to you like you're a UN official.

145
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.810
Let's get your embarrassing-ass lightsaber back

146
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.740
so you can swing it around instead of kissing girls.

147
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.800
Whoa, ho ho, you found me... found me... found me!

148
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.090
- Security breach. - What the hell?

149
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.000
Unauthorized presence.

150
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.390
What the fuck, Morty?!

151
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.050
This morning, a real-life version

152
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.300
of George Lucas's trademarked lightsaber was dropped point down

153
00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.480
and is whomp-whomping its way to the core of the Earth,

154
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.650
where it will blow us all up.

155
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.780
Touch my shit and die.

156
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.242
That's not a threat from me, that's how advanced my shit is.

157
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.160
Impressive lair, Sanchez.

158
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.787
Got about 600,000 permits?

159
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.360
If I wanted the government in my house,

160
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.800
- I'd buy an Alexa. - I invited him in, Rick.

161
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.120
Yeah, well, they can leave. I'll destroy it.

162
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.260
- We're gonna retrieve it. - Well, that's stupid.

163
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.900
What kind of grandfather are you?

164
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.460
It's Christmas, for God's sake,

165
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.000
and you look like Phil Spector wiped his ass with Randy Quaid.

166
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.140
If you're gonna help, help.

167
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.599
Otherwise step aside.

168
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.020
Merry Christmas to me.

169
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.800
- Merry Christmas to me! - To me!

170
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.200
Anyhoo, I'm no expert, but it seems we've got a...

171
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.730
a certain amount of time to build a big drill ship.

172
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.260
A big drill ship?

173
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.119
That's some pretty loud stepping aside you're doing.

174
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.900
- Just let me destroy the thing! - You've destroyed enough!

175
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.820
Ooooh!

176
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.920
Aah!

177
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.150
Oh, I see someone found my "told you so" dispenser.

178
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.620
Oh, my God, look at all these streets! We got 34th Street!

179
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.200
35th Street!

180
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.680
Oh, 36th Street coming too!

181
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.880
Oh, it's a miracle!

182
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.462
We got miracles on 37th Street!

183
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.960
38th! And don't even get me started on the avenues!

184
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.680
- I can't believe they cut this! - Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.860
Dad, you've been so great lately.

186
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.700
I'm almost afraid it's not real.

187
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.640
You're not a robot, are you?

188
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.840
Ha! Put it this way, honey... If I am,

189
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.580
I-I'm a robot programmed to love you very, very much.

190
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.080
Aww!

191
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.569
Will this drill down fast enough to get under the lightsaber?

192
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.580
Yep, it will be under the lightsaber in one hour

193
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.991
because the... wait, it's lower now.

194
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.242
Oh, right, it's moving.

195
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.330
You fucking idiot. Get out of here!

196
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.960
Good luck finding a good scientist on Christmas!

197
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.500
I'm President of the United Assholes.

198
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.850
All right, genius, I give you permission

199
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.049
to make our drill ship faster.

200
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.580
I'm not touching that thing. I'll get neurotypical cooties.

201
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.580
I have son-in-laws more imaginative.

202
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.710
All right, j-just destroy the lightsaber!

203
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.140
Thought you'd never ask. Not true. I knew you'd ask.

204
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.820
- What is that? - A second lightsaber

205
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.320
with an A.I.-controlled gyroscopic rocket in the hilt.

206
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.895
- You had a lightsaber?! - Oh, did you want one?

207
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.380
What a terrible gift that would have made.

208
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.480
Vertisaber, state your prime directive.

209
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.700
To stay vertical.

210
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.150
- Then show 'em how it's done. - Affirmative.

211
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.115
- Whoo! America! - Yeah! Oh, yeah.

212
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.840
Maintain verticality, Vertisaber.

213
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.950
Affirmative.

214
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960
All right, looking good.

215
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.916
- Stay on target. - Uh-huh.

216
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.880
Progress report.

217
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.540
Vertisaber, do you copy?

218
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.340
- Do I have to respond every time? - Excuse me?

219
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.299
I'm designed to stay perfectly vertical,

220
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.780
not to give constant affirmation.

221
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.229
You do your job, I'll do mine.

222
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.540
- I control you! - Okay, I'll just turn off my brain

223
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.517
and you can do that. Byyye!

224
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.477
Fucking kidding me? Shit!

225
00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:42.773
- Trajectory's drifting, sir. - Where is it coming out?

226
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.483
Looks like Italy, sir.

227
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.904
Okay, t-that could've been worse.

228
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.720
Aah!

229
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.420
Well, uh, that is definitely not amore.

230
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.180
Way to show us how it's done, Rick.

231
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.700
- Whatever. - Italian prime minister on line one.

232
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.730
Put him on hold.

233
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.760
We can pin this on the Saudis. This is something they'd do.

234
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.220
They may as well have done it.

235
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.750
They did do it.

236
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.620
Oh, there's another miracle at the end of the intersection

237
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.160
of 401st Boulevard and 7,000th Street!

238
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.480
That's a miracle per block so far.

239
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.040
Okay, even I am nearing my limit.

240
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.022
Let's play a Christmas game!

241
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.276
Oh. Uh, um... have you guys ever played "Are You a Robot?"

242
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.800
Each person here has to decide

243
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.446
whether or not t-they're a robot.

244
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.889
- Ohh, I'm gonna play that. - Yes, yes, yes.

245
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.970
But don't say it out loud. Because if you're a robot,

246
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.199
you're not allowed to say you are.

247
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.450
T-T-That's the rule.

248
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.100
That's the horrible, painful thing about being a robot.

249
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.660
But you do have to answer everyone's questions.

250
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.580
And it's their jobs to decide whether you are or aren't a robot,

251
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.800
because... because if you are a robot, you can't say!

252
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.540
You're not allowed to say at all.

253
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.050
- I'll go first! Uh, question. - Oh!

254
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.880
Ahh, are you a robot?

255
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.640
- Can I just ask that? - You can!

256
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.940
But don't forget that if I am,

257
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.800
I have to lie even though I don't want to.

258
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.000
- More questions? - Can you feel things?

259
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.580
Oh, fuck yes! Yes! T-That's the problem!

260
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.420
If I'm a robot, which I'm not...

261
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.960
don't forget I have to say that...

262
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.320
but yes, yes, I feel so much.

263
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.300
I'm filled with love for certain people,

264
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.060
but also filled with shame

265
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.080
if I'm programmed to deceive them, but that's a big if.

266
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.990
- What's your skeleton made of? - Titanium!

267
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.180
- You're... You're a robot! - Yes!

268
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.730
No! But that's what a robot would say!

269
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.900
So, you get the idea.

270
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.459
- Whoo! - Suck it, bitches!

271
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.110
This is fun! I've always been afraid to let my guard down

272
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.780
and just have stupid family fun like this,

273
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.216
but Grandpa Rick is making me learn to be vulnerable!

274
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.620
- Right on! - Me too!

275
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.800
- Ohh! - Mm!

276
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.959
_

277
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.150
All right, your derivative drill ship is now faster

278
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160
than a lightsaber.

279
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.560
Morty, y-you want front or back?

280
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.140
Who says the two of us are going?

281
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.479
Y-You didn't even want to...

282
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.720
Oh, for fuck's sake. Bye!

283
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.280
Good luck. Don't blow up my planet.

284
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.693
You act like you're the one that got stabbed in the back!

285
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.200
Because I am the one, Morty.

286
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.750
You want to know why I replaced myself

287
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.010
in the beginning of that stupid Knights of the Sun thing?

288
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.770
I said don't take the fucking sword,

289
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.270
and you were like "whatever,"

290
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.140
like I'm our neighbor Gene or David Arquette or something.

291
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.240
You called me boring.

292
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.920
I've become dog shit to you.

293
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.570
That's what happens when you let people in

294
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.739
and they stop respecting you.

295
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.540
They touch your shit, they screw things up,

296
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.980
they kill your fucking family.

297
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.000
Go ahead. Trust him.

298
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.650
You're gonna learn the same fucking thing.

299
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.660
I... am not going to kill your family, Morty.

300
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.860
That means a lot.

301
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.240
In case this goes south, any last words, Morty?

302
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.119
I've never been old enough to vote, Mr. President,

303
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.100
but when I am, I'll vote for you.

304
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.930
Thanks, Morty. Every vote counts.

305
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.879
If you want, I can have them legally change your age.

306
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.908
Uh, no, I-I'm not in any hurry to get into that shit show.

307
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.700
Approaching the lightsaber in T-minus...

308
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.990
oh, shit, now.

309
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.600
T-minus now! Sorry!

310
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.280
I missed countdown day at the academy.

311
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.610
Now or never, Morty!

312
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.588
- There it is! - Reverse the jets!

313
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.330
I got this! Ugh!

314
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.553
No... I do!

315
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.200
Morty, you magnificent little bastard!

316
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.724
Let's get this thing topside.

317
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.480
May the force be with... me!

318
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.500
I think you mean with me.

319
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.170
What? You hate Star Wars.

320
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.170
I was your age when this shit was in theaters.

321
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.980
This franchise raised me,

322
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.760
trained me, taught me good from evil,

323
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.570
made having a bad father empowering.

324
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.520
And when that third movie got all... muppety,

325
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.120
something in me began to rot.

326
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.290
But make no mistake, child,

327
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.190
I own Star Wars, not you.

328
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.320
Not that bubble-throat pompadour fuck,

329
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.000
not some Mickey Mouse shit machine.

330
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.920
They didn't pay the price with their souls.

331
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.500
I did! I earned this, not you!

332
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.980
America, transform and roll out!

333
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.763
Bastard!

334
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.620
Rick, I would be honored if you would carve the ham this year.

335
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.860
- Whoa. Dad. That's... - Unheard of?

336
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.120
You're quite right, Summer.

337
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.720
It's my way of saying I see your mom's father

338
00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.720
as my father too.

339
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.657
Ohh, Jerry, w-w-why don't you cut it?

340
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.240
Geez, Dad, what the hell are you doing?

341
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.454
He's like adopting you into his biological family, Grandpa.

342
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.000
Morty, I am sure glad to see you.

343
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.280
Y-Y-You ready to tag your old grandpa back in?

344
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.720
You're not my grandpa. You're a fucking robot.

345
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.500
Finally.

346
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.767
âª The first Noel âª

347
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:34.230
âª The angels did say âª

348
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.320
âª Was to certain poor shepherds âª

349
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.830
âª In fields as they lay âª

350
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.330
Okay, okay, okay.

351
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.420
Oop!

352
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.707
Aww!

353
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.500
Summer, do you have any drugs?

354
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.560
- Are you serious? - I guess not.

355
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.960
I'm just glad I'm not the one that ruined Christmas.

356
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.219
- People of Earth... - Hmm, that's never good.

357
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.900
I'm not here to play the blame game,

358
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.130
but Morty Smith got a lightsaber for Christmas,

359
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.860
dropped it, and it's now heading for the Earth's core again...

360
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.019
I-I mean for the first time.

361
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.900
Son of a bitch! He played with it!

362
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.220
If it does reach the core, it will blow all of you up.

363
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.270
I-I mean all of us up.

364
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.460
But don't abandon hope.

365
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.500
We're doing everything we can to stop it,

366
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.350
and only if that fails,

367
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.500
will we launch the White House into space...

368
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.100
Welp, I'm busted. Clearly in space already.

369
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.030
- You did ruin Christmas. - Nunh-unh!

370
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.020
He stole my lightsaber and must've dropped it!

371
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.520
A-A second time!

372
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.130
Does that mean you stopped it a first time? How?

373
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.420
- A drill ship. - A drill ship? Awesome!

374
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.690
It was, but the government took it with them.

375
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.339
Then we lean on the only asshole smart enough

376
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.020
to make another one in this tight a window.

377
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.330
But Rick's gone.

378
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.500
And I'm not sure he's ever coming back.

379
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.102
Then let's settle for the next best thing.

380
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.310
Oh, fuck! Just let me die!

381
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.280
Turn me off... not that I can be turned off

382
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.568
because I'm obviously not a robot!

383
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.592
Fuck yeah! I got you.

384
00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.428
Okay, I can... I can work with that.

385
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.470
Aaaah!

386
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.550
What do you mean the White House chef was grocery shopping?

387
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.340
Well, do you know how to make an egg?

388
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.420
You do? Everyone does?

389
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.530
Good news, sir.

390
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.619
The lightsaber was intercepted before it hit the core.

391
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.160
All right, here we go! Ha ha!

392
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.260
I don't suppose you could send it up here.

393
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.327
Uh, who intercepted it, anyway?

394
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.760
That's the bad news.

395
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.140
That is bad news.

396
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.960
Hey, Mister P. Drop something?

397
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.419
Morty! I see you and, uh, Rick patched things up. That's nice.

398
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.280
No, the real Rick and I have never been worse

399
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.010
thanks to that wedge you drove between us

400
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.180
just to get that lightsaber!

401
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.360
Yeah, well, looks like you got it back.

402
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.140
Your journey is complete.

403
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.280
- As a nerd! - You're the nerd!

404
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.320
You can't say all that crazy shit about Star Wars

405
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.350
- and then act like you're cool! - Oh, really?

406
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.990
Would a person who wasn't cool have one of these?

407
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.444
I think so?

408
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.280
Slowly closing door! Slide!

409
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.700
Oh, no! I-I'm not gonna make it.

410
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.100
What a shame to be put out of my misery again.

411
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.320
Aw, man.

412
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.370
What the hell?

413
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.260
W-Was this always part of the White House?

414
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.172
Carter built it with his own two hands.

415
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.740
Reagan tried to destroy it.

416
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.400
George W. added kegs to the cantina.

417
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.513
But only I saw its true value.

418
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.370
Mr. President, you need to come home

419
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.599
and tell the people the truth.

420
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.269
The fuck I do. Droids, get that saber!

421
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.380
Give it a minute.

422
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.900
Usually comes out on the fourth try.

423
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.280
All right! Here we go!

424
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.861
Look at 'em... lightsaber hands!

425
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:10.363
Tell me that's not cool.

426
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.520
It's not! I always wanted to fight with a lightsaber,

427
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.560
but not like this.

428
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.170
- Y-You ruined it! - Disney ruined it!

429
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.260
You think I want 30 low-rent TV series with bad CGI?

430
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.375
They film everything on that one big green screen.

431
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.876
Like you've got better ideas.

432
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.260
I've got a million.

433
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.950
Here's one... a robot with lightsabers for eyes!

434
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.280
God damn it, he can't see!

435
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.970
It was a good idea otherwise.

436
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.232
Uh, admit it, you were intimidated.

437
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.230
Uh, now, Morty...

438
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.700
Come on, put down the lightsaber Gatling gun.

439
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.951
We had our fun, right?

440
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.622
Star Wars rules say you have to forgive me.

441
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.510
I-I'm done with that, and I'm done with you!

442
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.126
- Morty, nooo! - Rickbot!

443
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.540
He sacrificed his life for me.

444
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.820
Yeah, don't be too touched, he's actively trying to die.

445
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.700
Ugh. I-It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

446
00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.260
Oh, God, t-they're sliding, Morty!

447
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.890
T-They're sliding! They're sliding!

448
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.645
âª The first Noel âª

449
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.380
âª The angels âª

450
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.815
Perfectly fucking vertical.

451
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.944
Ohh! Ooh!

452
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.050
Save yourself, Morty! Rick can build another me.

453
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.500
If... If I was a robot, w-which I'm not.

454
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.870
I don't want another you.

455
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.720
Nooo!

456
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.180
Rick? You came to help!

457
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.680
Better tend to your little toaster.

458
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.140
I... I'm I'm coughing up oil, Morty.

459
00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.660
Oh, Rickbot, I-I never should've pushed you away.

460
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.260
Y-You were... you were so great.

461
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.440
Of course I'm great. I'm Rick.

462
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.850
Rick literally built me to make you happy, Morty.

463
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.280
Anything I do is technically something Rick did.

464
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.460
But maybe he can do a little more him... himself.

465
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.590
God, how long do you take to die?

466
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.720
Goodbye, Morty. Uh...

467
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.040
Ugh, Jesus.

468
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.480
Uh, Rick, uh...

469
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.720
I guess this is a bad time to ask for a new White House?

470
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.087
Morty, would you mind calling me an Uber?

471
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.820
Right, well, uh... Merry Christmas.

472
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.610
I guess I'll go watch a guy scream about streets with the family.

473
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.820
- Also, you need to shower. - Hey, maybe the robot's right.

474
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.020
I-I should have included you in my shit.

475
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.780
You can help me if you want.

476
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.030
Wow, are those all the places Rick Prime could be?

477
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.300
I wish, Morty.

478
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.920
It's all the places he is.

479
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.500
- Oh, geez. - Welcome to my darkness.

480
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.900
I spent my life hunting this guy, Morty!

481
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.820
This is the closest I've ever been to catching Rick Prime.

482
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.840
It's impossible!

483
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.084
He... He's an incredibly crafty piece of shit.

484
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.820
Hunting him destroyed me, Morty!

485
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.480
But now we're gonna do it together!

486
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.500
- You and me! - Oh!

487
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.219
- Uh... - It's gonna take over your life, Morty!

488
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.676
Rick and Morty, season seven, hunting my nemesis!

489
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.580
Maybe trying to stay healthy while doing it!

490
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.680
Juggling plates!

491
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.960
And not every episode, Morty!

492
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.019
It could be all happening in the background! Who knows?

493
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.760
You know, n-no one will, except us!

494
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.360
I-It's the most painful shit I've ever had to deal with

495
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.819
and I'm fucking bringing you into it

496
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.400
because you asked for it, Morty!

497
00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.599
You and me, Morty!

498
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.860
Ooo-wee! What a season, huh?

499
00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.519
Rick Prime! Therapy!

500
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.340
And that thing we did with Roy.

501
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.780
Remember thaaat?

502
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.680
Sorry I wasn't around,

503
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.020
been busy getting my little poopybutt in shape.

504
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.820
Been tonin' and bonin'! Whew!

505
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.620
Y-You might think I'm over-compensating for the emptiness

506
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.400
after Amy left with Poopy Jr.,

507
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.080
but my trainer Caaarl says the best way to get over a girl

508
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.760
is to get under a 300-pound squat.

509
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.900
Damn right.

510
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.740
Ha! Oo-wee, that's the good stuff!

511
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.130
Oh, sugar! Oh, sugar! Oh, sugar!

512
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.500
Oh, is it... is it bad?

513
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.480
Oh! It's... It's really bad, isn't it?

514
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.300
Oh, sug... oh!

515
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.300
Someone call Amy, tell her I need her.

516
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.640
Tell her I love her!

517
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.340
Not my phone. She blocked me. U-Use yours.

518
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.104
Oo-weee! I am broken!

519
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.107
Did you get any of that?
