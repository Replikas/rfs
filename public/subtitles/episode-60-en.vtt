1
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.600
Why are we waiting in line for food?

2
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.000
It's a pop-up. It's a rare, pop-up restaurant thing

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.010
that only enters our solar system... Rick.

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.549
You're gonna spoil your appetite.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.249
That's a weird way to say I'm gonna stop being hungry

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.960
by eating food, but whatever.

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.400
Three crispy, uh, four wiggling.

8
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.609
You're probably not even hungry.

9
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.779
You just don't like lines because they aren't about you.

10
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.030
Another weirdly aggressive way

11
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.240
to describe a friend respecting themselves.

12
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.880
- Eugh! - What a wonderful thing to say!

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.620
Ha ha! I was merely inspired by the wonderful thing you said!

14
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.820
Sirs? Guys? You dropped this.

15
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.340
Please, take it as a reward. So courteous!

16
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.180
How nice it will be for you to eat

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.160
what you were willing to stand in line for so much sooner.

18
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.200
Oh, no, that's okay.

19
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.060
I came to stand in line and then eat.

20
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.600
I-I wouldn't wanna do it differently.

21
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.800
Hmm...

22
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.880
Dear fellow, I choose this moment

23
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.670
to surrender my sword so that you may succeed me

24
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.470
as the newest Knight of the Sun.

25
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.300
What? No. I-I-I didn't even want your sandwich.

26
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.518
I don't want your sword.

27
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.562
Oh, believe me, son. You want it.

28
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.450
I don't understand. You're knights? With a "K"?

29
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.067
Of the Sun with a "U" or... or an "O"?

30
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.180
Your alphabet is of no concern here.

31
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.820
We are sworn defenders of Helios,

32
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.760
the center of this system.

33
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.360
Okay, so it's "Sun" with a "U."

34
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.730
Oh, God. Morty, don't take the sword.

35
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.800
Oh, I'm shocked you're against something, Rick.

36
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.759
- You know these guys? - I know how they're dressed

37
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.140
and how boring this sounds.

38
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.170
You take that sword,

39
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.340
you're gonna get sucked into a whole complicated...

40
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.588
Oh, shit!

41
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.480
- Come on, take it. - Uh...

42
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.219
I mean, if that kid's not gonna take the sword...

43
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.560
He didn't offer it to you.

44
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.240
Sorry. Can I just ask some stuff?

45
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.805
W-What does a Knight of the Sun do?

46
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.500
He takes the sword, for one thing.

47
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.351
You know what? Maybe you made a bad call.

48
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.479
- He... He doesn't want the sword. - I didn't say that.

49
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.854
Well, you sure aren't taking it.

50
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.189
Would you just take a random...

51
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.240
Obviously I would, yes! And I did!

52
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.880
Best decision of my life! And you're shitting on it!

53
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.650
Excuse me? Is this just a free sword?

54
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.230
- No! - I'm taking the sword.

55
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.740
Thank you, Dawnling. What is your name?

56
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.070
- Morty. - Now it is Sir Mortaniel.

57
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.746
I made it a little knightier.

58
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.190
Good day.

59
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.582
Wait, did he just...

60
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.600
God damn it, Morty! You took the sword?

61
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.150
- So boring! - Oh, like you're not at this point?

62
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.740
You drunk cranky fuck!

63
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080
Ouch.

64
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.580
You guys still gonna stand in line?

65
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.350
Y-You're not gonna take this food?

66
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.760
The pop-up pays us to stand here.

67
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.600
- To drive up business. - Knew it.

68
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.340
Everyone! Sir Helios' successor, Sir Mortaniel!

69
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.040
âª Sir Mortaniel, face so bright âª

70
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.620
âª Serves the Sun with strength and might âª

71
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.280
âª Sir Mortaniel, come and see âª

72
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.775
âª Just what the Sun provides for thee âª

73
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.694
Wow, my... my own song!

74
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.020
Now you know why Sir Helios had to change your name

75
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.830
to something with three syllables.

76
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.330
Welcome, Dawnling, to the Sun!

77
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.078
So it is the Sun, like Earth's sun?

78
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.164
Ah-ha, he's heard of us!

79
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.291
How come I'm not, like, burning to a crisp?

80
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.000
You are currently protected by our powers,

81
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.860
but soon they will be yours.

82
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.180
Our flesh is indestructible!

83
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.200
Our lives are never-ending,

84
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.140
but not even in the dumb vampire way

85
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.340
where after a while you hate it and you can't die.

86
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.930
We can die whenever we want.

87
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.056
We just don't have to.

88
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.890
But you're not allowed to leave, right?

89
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.478
L-Like, I'll... I'll... I'll never see my family again?

90
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.740
We leave constantly!

91
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.272
I met you on an asteroid.

92
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.820
Oh, yeah. Between us, that wasn't a deal breaker,

93
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.449
but it's even better that there's options.

94
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.450
You'll have more freedom than you've ever known.

95
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.760
Our king.

96
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.270
The Sun is the center of the solar system.

97
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.100
It is the home of the solar Scepter,

98
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.940
around which all worlds revolve.

99
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.880
The men who keep it safe are admired by all and live as gods.

100
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.544
- Any more questions? - Uh, yeah, where do I sign?

101
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.560
Huzzah.

102
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.660
Well, that does it.

103
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.730
Off to the parapet to make this official.

104
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.176
Yeah, let's do this.

105
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.980
Now just cut off your penises and throw them into the Sun.

106
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.392
Oooooooookey-dokey.

107
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.311
I see Mortaniel wants to go first.

108
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.510
Uh, not true.

109
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.340
Do I just leave the sword wherever?

110
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.400
- I-Is there a sword bin? - What are you saying?

111
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.779
- You don't want to cut off... - Listen, guys, c-can we not...

112
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.180
It's a terrific and painful sacrifice we all make

113
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.020
for the most important and powerful job in the universe.

114
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.220
We've done it since the dawn of dawns.

115
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.245
Yep. There it is in stained glass.

116
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.790
It's official. A-And I'm not judging it.

117
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.123
And I'm not doing it.

118
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.240
People really live here? This is nuts.

119
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.150
- I thought it was a metaphor. - We have to go.

120
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.250
Ah. Boy. They're not messing around, huh?

121
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.382
How are you not burning?

122
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.850
Oh, it's just science, which, unless I'm misinterpreting,

123
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.553
is clearly not a priority here.

124
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.660
Okay, c'mon, lil' June bug.

125
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.280
I-I won't rub your face in this one.

126
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.019
I-I'm guessing you're feeling pretty stupid.

127
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.680
Yes. Thank you.

128
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.430
Sir Helios gave his life with that sword.

129
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.600
Mortaniel took it.

130
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.610
He cannot leave unless he bests me in combat.

131
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.640
Hmm. Okay, uh, one sec.

132
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.579
I'm guessing these guys are, like, pseudo-immortalish

133
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.489
since they live on the Sun, so playing by their rules

134
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.829
might be the fastest way out of this.

135
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.200
J-Just best him in combat.

136
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.320
- What? - Here.

137
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.920
This sword uses A.I. to learn from an opponent's attacks.

138
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.290
So I have to get attacked first?

139
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.140
No, no, no, the sword has already seen "Blade."

140
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.940
And loved it. You'll be fine.

141
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.040
- By golly! - Ooh! Crikey!

142
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.220
Okay, so we're done here.

143
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.180
No. We're not done.

144
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.390
I am done.

145
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.892
You are now king of the Sun.

146
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.850
Protect the Scepter always.

147
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.450
No, no, no, no, I don't want to!

148
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.200
Well, how is that supposed to work?

149
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.980
He's king, but he was never even a knight.

150
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.679
- I mean, that's stupid. - Uh, it's... it's definitely a... Sun first.

151
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.033
- A king with a penis? - Well, what do you want from me?!

152
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.620
All hail King Mortaniel!

153
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.800
Uhhhhh, as your king,

154
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.560
I hereby declare a vacation, for me.

155
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.360
I'll come visit you guys, on, like, Sun Day...

156
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.460
Sundays.

157
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.980
If I forget, just wait a week.

158
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.672
Keep doing that, keep the crown. Peace.

159
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.360
Hell yeah. See? That's from when he's fighting Deacon Frost.

160
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.250
I don't know. Um, I-I thought it was cool.

161
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.500
Okay. So...

162
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.440
So? Oh. So, you dragged me to a fake restaurant,

163
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.899
yelled at me for not doing what you wanted,

164
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.400
then did something I told you not to,

165
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.878
and it almost cost you your pud, but I saved your life,

166
00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.159
and now you're waiting for me to make you feel like shit about it.

167
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.960
That's... Yeah, you nailed it.

168
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.750
Morty, I'm sorry I let your opinion of me get this low.

169
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.740
- All right, I get it. - There's nothing to get.

170
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.410
I'm for real. Look, I'm a drunk, I'm a psychopath,

171
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.520
I'm a murderer, but...

172
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.489
- when you called me boring... - I shouldn't have.

173
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.749
... I needed to hear it.

174
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.180
And you took the stupid sword, and I was like, "Holy crap,

175
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.400
this is who I am to this kid?

176
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.319
He just does the opposite of my advice now.

177
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.800
I mean, I-I gotta fix that."

178
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.820
So I'm gonna be, like, 22% more agreeable with you

179
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.440
for, like, maybe one episode, or one adventure.

180
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.730
- We'll see how it goes. - Is 22% a lot?

181
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.779
Well, I-I'm not gonna tell you

182
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.939
what percentage of our time together I'm usually mean to you

183
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.339
because it'll hurt your stupid feelings,

184
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.880
but 22% is substantial.

185
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.139
You're gonna feel the difference.

186
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.400
Okay. I mean, I-I appreciate it.

187
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.739
You should, because you made a real mess with these guys.

188
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.900
- Oh, man! - Sire.

189
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.030
- You can't leave. - Go away!

190
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.220
My king, it is our duty to follow you

191
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.360
till the sun sets on our watch.

192
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.940
I mean, it set yesterday, so you're done. Bye.

193
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.001
Sire, the sun never sets on the Sun.

194
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.220
Can you get rid of them?

195
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.440
You want me to...

196
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.200
Well... You guys know he can kill you, right?

197
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.550
I think he'd find that quite difficult, sire,

198
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.900
but if it pleases you.

199
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.820
Can't I just tell you it pleases me for you to go away?

200
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.980
No. Not really.

201
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.180
So you'd rather die than leave me alone?

202
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.390
Yes.

203
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.640
âª A pheasant plucked for my good king âª

204
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.320
âª A merry jig, sweet songbirds sing âª

205
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.440
These guys live on our sun? I've never heard of them.

206
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.020
I don't see them doing a lot to earn interplanetary fame.

207
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.500
I beg your pardon, wizard.

208
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.160
The Knights of the Sun protect the solar Scepter...

209
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.520
around which even this world turns.

210
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.070
You do mean that, like, symbolically, right?

211
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.600
Oh, quite literally.

212
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.800
The Scepter is the center of the solar system.

213
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.340
All planets orbit it. We keep it on the Sun

214
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.172
so that Jupiter and Saturn don't bump into each other.

215
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.920
- Omigod. - They don't even know sixth grade science.

216
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.170
That's it!

217
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.820
- _ - Yeah, so there you have it.

218
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.850
Traditions suck ass,

219
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.098
and your most foundational beliefs are total bullshit.

220
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.320
We're supposed to take your word for it?

221
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.200
Anyone can draw circles on a board and spout numbers.

222
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.120
Yes, this sounds like a fun theory, sire,

223
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.199
but it would take more than this for us to give up...

224
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.370
Okay, so how do you guys think it works again?

225
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.780
- Well, the Scepter... - Oh, you mean this old thing?

226
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.140
- Gaaah! - You want it?

227
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.270
Here. Take it back home.

228
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.160
It's a symbol. It's your culture.

229
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.078
That's not the same as reality.

230
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.950
Does this mean we cut off our penises

231
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.830
for absolutely no reason?

232
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.850
That's the bad news.

233
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.700
The good news is, you're free.

234
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.300
- Ooh, that stings. - Fuck this knights shit.

235
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.740
A query?

236
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.020
I just used your "computer phone" to search "despair."

237
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.250
- Where can I get this heroin? - I'm not telling you that.

238
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.580
No matter. I'm seeing from most of your song lyrics

239
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.010
that I can get it anywhere.

240
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.020
Um, you guys, someone just used critical thinking and basic physics

241
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.260
to destroy their first entire religion.

242
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.850
- Nice. - Good job, Morty.

243
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.900
- So no more sun-tourage? - Yep. All done.

244
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.640
Plus, Rick and I both learned to support each other better.

245
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.658
So that's it. We're done.

246
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.480
Feels early, but w-we're done.

247
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.580
What's happening?

248
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.705
Appliances are breaking that I haven't touched.

249
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.870
Maybe the sun is... celebrating?

250
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.040
Ha ha ha ha! The Sons of the Moon are storming the walkway.

251
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.100
Doesn't matter.

252
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.459
Their aggression will be kept in check

253
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.100
by a host of interplanetary treaties and alliances.

254
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.120
It's very complicated,

255
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.179
but as long as The Knights of the Sun stand together,

256
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.440
the solar system will always have complete political stability.

257
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.320
Where are the Knights of the Sun, by the way?

258
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.780
I'm done pooping.

259
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.800
Hmm?

260
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.050
Did the, uh, Knights of the Sun... disband?

261
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.950
While I was pooping?

262
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.940
Sunnnn-kward.

263
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.440
_

264
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.320
How many planets in our solar system have these clowns?

265
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.550
I guess if the sun can support life, any planet can.

266
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.000
I mean, maybe we all descended from a common ancestor.

267
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.040
Haven't you seen, like, all of the universes?

268
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.960
Exactly. So why would I hang out on Pluto?

269
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.549
That's some Jerry-league shit.

270
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.260
If the Sons of the Moon can attack the sun,

271
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.400
why should the Viscounts of Venus continue sitting

272
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.930
- in Saturn's shadow? - How's this for a reason?

273
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.017
We got all the rings and all the balls.

274
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.140
- Oh, fuck you. - Really?

275
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.740
If the Saturno Venusian dÃ©tente is no longer honored,

276
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.620
I declare you all moons of Jupiter.

277
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.360
Because that's what you are to us! A bunch of moons!

278
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.060
Do the Knights of the Sun plan to protect Mercury from this chaos?

279
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.600
Because if we're on our own,

280
00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.577
there's a new, very tiny sun in town.

281
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.020
It's all you, pal.

282
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.380
Um, hello?

283
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.921
Don't I have, like, authority over this Sons of the Moon meeting?

284
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.006
That all depends. Who the hell are you?

285
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.520
This guy's the king of the Sun.

286
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.343
- Holy shit. - When did this happen?

287
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.845
Ha! Then tell your knights to do their jobs.

288
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.440
Yes, Your Majesty.

289
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.480
We all know the Sun's power lives

290
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.120
and dies with your knights.

291
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.560
- Who are you? - Who am... Who...

292
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.520
I am the Marquis of Mars!

293
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.800
And I declare war on all of you!

294
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.360
War on all of you!

295
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.700
Where are the Knights of the Sun when we need them most?

296
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.000
Funny you should ask, uh...

297
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.280
They're gone!

298
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.400
They've abandoned their duties.

299
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.070
I see it in the bones.

300
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.480
Damn, the bones nailed it.

301
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.080
Okay, so you have space ships and magic ladies?

302
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.720
Look, I'm not gonna read all the books.

303
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.960
What will it take to let this Sons of the Moon fiasco resolve itself?

304
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.040
Excuse me. How did you become king of the Sun?

305
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.590
You look like an Earthling.

306
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.302
- Santa? - Santa?

307
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.450
What the hell is that?

308
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.472
I'm the Earl of Earth, god damn it.

309
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.520
I agree with Earth on one thing...

310
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.430
Venus questions the legitimacy of this king's authority.

311
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.920
My people say I say aye.

312
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.100
I'm the king.

313
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.569
- I've got the Scepter right here. - What the fuck?

314
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.560
Yeah, yeah, I know you're freaking out

315
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.730
because it's not on the sun.

316
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.560
No, because whoever has it rules the solar system!

317
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.158
It's up for grabs! Get it!

318
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.560
After it!

319
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.680
Ahhhh!

320
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.600
Yes, yes. I have the Scepter.

321
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.210
Soon Jupiter will be the center

322
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.660
of our solar system's newest dark ages.

323
00:12:30.682 --> 00:12:34.560
Fuck that. Mercury will now be the shining beacon of...

324
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.040
Time to throw it all against the wall.

325
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.899
I think you crushed it.

326
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.500
I mean, not just anybody can start Solar War One.

327
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.580
- Stop supporting me. - Can do.

328
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.359
_

329
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.860
_

330
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:08.830
_

331
00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:21.634
_

332
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.891
_

333
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.019
Damn, who would have thought giving the Amish nukes

334
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.550
would threaten the solar system?

335
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.237
Maybe we should just jump universes.

336
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.250
I don't know, buddy.

337
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.280
Feels like we're kind of more about trying out commitment now, ya know?

338
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.359
Let's put our heads together.

339
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.719
Maybe there's something we haven't tried yet.

340
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.787
- Oh, here's an idea. Fuck you! - Hey!

341
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.860
Rick, I can't take it.

342
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.460
I admit I'm wrong, I screwed up.

343
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.400
You're killing me here yes-and'ing me to death.

344
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.600
What is this, "Vat of Acid" again?

345
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.740
Look, man, I'm sorry I've been such a dick in the past

346
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.297
that you think I'm doing a thing here.

347
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.900
I'm honestly just trying to do better by you.

348
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.200
Are you a robot?

349
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.230
- Morty! - A clone?

350
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.719
Morty, this family's got enough clones and robots in it.

351
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.509
Come on, Morty, stop asking what you're asking

352
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.100
and let's just get back to our crisis.

353
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.019
I'm sorry. It's just been a hard road with you, Rick.

354
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.710
Morty, I get that, but you can trust me

355
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.600
when I say I'm just trying to do right by you.

356
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.600
Okay, Rick. You're right. Maybe...

357
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.987
maybe I just need to round up some Knights.

358
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.600
If I disillusioned the old ones,

359
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.480
I'll just have to re-illusion them.

360
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.200
It shouldn't be that hard, right?

361
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.820
Cousins, we need to return to the walkway at once.

362
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.339
Why are you laughing? Did I say something funny?

363
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.840
Oh, Mortaniel.

364
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.080
The only person we bend the knee to these days

365
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.470
is that sweet Black Betty.

366
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.230
Yeah, man, all hail Mr. Brownstone.

367
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.892
And his doctor. Feelgood, that is.

368
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.260
They're talking about heroin, Morty. They like it.

369
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.979
- Obviously. - Obviously?!

370
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.250
Apparently living on the Sun

371
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.960
has turned our veins into triple-bonded carbon,

372
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.300
so try this tale on for size, Mortaniel...

373
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.695
we can't OD!

374
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.370
C'mon, you guys are a mess.

375
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.270
Well, they actually seem kinda awesome, Morty.

376
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.400
Lemme be your king.

377
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.410
I admit, I wanted what you once had...

378
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.960
brotherhood, tradition, stability, purpose.

379
00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.500
I just... didn't want to cut my dick off for it.

380
00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.789
Yeah, that's the point.

381
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.840
We were quick to follow this boy before,

382
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.520
without even forcing him to commit to our traditions.

383
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.800
And all he did was break our faith and our walkway.

384
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.140
And now this random fucking guy is here again

385
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.540
to tell us what to do?

386
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.056
No fucking way!

387
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.470
What if I cut off my dick?

388
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.080
But you'd be cutting it off for no reason.

389
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.800
Yeah, that's the point of tradition...

390
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.400
doing things for no reason,

391
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.740
but it'd be reason enough doing it for you guys.

392
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.240
Well, you do that, that would compete with heroin.

393
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.991
Cool, cool. Can I maybe get a minute?

394
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.360
Buddy, what's up?

395
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.900
Reaching some sad conclusions about your situation?

396
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.900
Yes, but that walkway needs those knights,

397
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.709
those knights need a king, and that king needs no dick.

398
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.130
Damn, Morty, you really are stepping up.

399
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.810
Now do you want me to help you

400
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.139
not have to cut your dick off, though?

401
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.175
- Yes, please. - Then I got you.

402
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.593
Uh, you really mean it, Rick?

403
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.550
Of course, buddy. I'll give you a fake dick

404
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.920
with three layers of fail-safes.

405
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.101
They'll never know the difference.

406
00:16:56.102 --> 00:16:59.602
Shh, Morty. We're gonna make your dick so fake, buddy.

407
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.680
The signal! Sir, the Knights of the Sun are once more.

408
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.050
Hold fire. If this return to the Old Ways is true,

409
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.340
I'd be willing to return home and put an end to the bloodshed.

410
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.060
Sir? Shall we hold off on the antimatter hydrogen bombing?

411
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.090
Those crusty knights won't do the Sun much good

412
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.280
without their... Hoo!

413
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.892
Let's hear them out.

414
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.240
I, Lithdor, son of Thrifdor,

415
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.150
personally oversee the stumping of thy king's stem.

416
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.370
If his stem burns true,

417
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.240
peace will be restored between the spheres.

418
00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.407
Yay!

419
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.911
Present the Shears of Stumping!

420
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.780
- Morty the Brave! - You got this, my king!

421
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.160
First things first.

422
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.240
Step through this machine

423
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.000
which checks for nanotechnological hologram dicks.

424
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.605
- What?! - War opened our eyes

425
00:18:11.606 --> 00:18:13.760
to the wonders of new technologies.

426
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.970
Please, step through, my liege.

427
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.850
Whew!

428
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.860
Sorry, my lord,

429
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.239
but we're gonna need you to step through this second machine,

430
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.630
which checks for emergency clone dicks.

431
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.660
Oh, wow, you guys really embraced a lot of specific new tech, huh?

432
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.190
- Whoa, a sunspot! - What? Where?

433
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.700
Boy, is... is that a third detector I see, as well?

434
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.560
You'll find out after the second one.

435
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.689
We don't like to reveal them

436
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.520
until the previous detecting threshold has been crossed.

437
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.720
Right.

438
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.600
The third detector is going to scan for a prosthetic dick.

439
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.240
- Oh. Ha ha. Good. - Okay, well, go on through,

440
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.910
and, of course, by "prosthetic" we mean witchcraft dick.

441
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.973
- Shit. - Fuck!

442
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.000
I sense one.

443
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.780
The bones say he's still packin'.

444
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.380
Ha ha, can't get nothin' past the chicken bone lady.

445
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.050
J-Just testing her.

446
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.028
Stump. Thy. Stem.

447
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.540
Morty? Morty, don't answer out loud.

448
00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.220
Can you hear me? It's Rick. I'm talking to you with my mind.

449
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.079
- Yeah, I can hear you. - You said that out loud.

450
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.830
- Don't speak. - Sorry. Sorry.

451
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.780
I uplinked a telepathic nano satellite

452
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.209
so we could hear each other's thoughts.

453
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.010
Carefully do everything I tell you

454
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.060
in the exact order I tell you to do it.

455
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.970
- Okay. - Grab the scissors.

456
00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.258
Okay. Got the scissors.

457
00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.592
Now... run!

458
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.262
- Oh, shit, shit! - Guards, seize them!

459
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.999
Run? You couldn't have just said that?!

460
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.309
You don't have to use telepathy anymore.

461
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.540
You can just ask your rhetorical questions out loud.

462
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.720
I don't understand, Rick.

463
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.900
Here's something that's easy to understand, buddy...

464
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.360
I'm proud of you for trying to solve your own shit.

465
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.024
Ugh, I didn't want to have to do this.

466
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.160
It's okay this time. We don't have any choice.

467
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.447
- I love you, Rick. - Love you, too, buddy.

468
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.160
Whoooooaaa!

469
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.110
And that's when King Morty and Rick

470
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.870
were left with no choice but to leap into the Sun.

471
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.000
Such shame he felt for what he'd done to our society,

472
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.960
sacrificing his dick wasn't enough...

473
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.620
He gave his entire body and wizard servant, as well.

474
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.400
And after a while, their sun-proof bones floated up to the top.

475
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.690
We even checked with a royal ladle to ensure it was real sun,

476
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.476
not just them hiding beneath in a vat of fake sun.

477
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.460
Such a violent death.

478
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.080
And finally when our grief could bear no more,

479
00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.700
we decided to abolish our medieval act of stem stumping.

480
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.180
And we have King Morty the Molten to thank for that.

481
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.610
Morty the Molten!

482
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.410
King Morty the Molten!

483
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.120
See, Morty? Worked like a charm.

484
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.380
Aren't we risking it all coming back here?

485
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.040
Morty, we had to know. Plus the heat...

486
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.620
- It's good for my joints. - King Mortaniel?!

487
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.750
You're alive?!

488
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.920
Yeah, go tell everybody.

489
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.960
Your reward's gonna be cutting off your own dick.

490
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.720
Right. Point taken.

491
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.760
R.I.P. and cheerio.

492
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.636
Whew!

493
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.530
One crispy, one wriggling.

494
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.713
Coming right up. Three loozums.

495
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.466
- How 'bout ten years? In jail. - Huh?

496
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.300
Special Agent Mongo Bongo.

497
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.070
You're under arrest for illegal hot dog trafficking.

498
00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:47.598
Oh!

499
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.683
_

500
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.489
Be free, my little babies. Ahh!

501
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.680
Huh.

502
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.590
Surprised they actually made it.

503
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.328
Kinda thought maybe some birds would swoop down...

504
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.720
Aaahhhhh! Aah!

505
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.915
I jinxed it. Aah!

506
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.918
Did you get any of that?
