1
00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:05.799
Get us out of here. I'll hold them off.

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.737
My name is Beth Smith.

3
00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:14.057
Tell your top bugs the Defiance lives on.

4
00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:15.477
I will. I will.

5
00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:17.147
I'll make you a legend. Blade Smith.

6
00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:19.279
- Beth Smith. - Beth. Beth. Beth Smith.

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.427
Okay, God, it's just such a plain...

8
00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:23.400
I'm trying to come up with a mnemonic device.

9
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.110
You could connect it to not dying.

10
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:27.329
I know, I know! You think that would sear it right in,

11
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.459
but it just speaks to the sheer forgettability.

12
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.339
Oh, God. I-I-I'm, uh, so sorry. Uh, uh, oh, God.

13
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.989
Starts with a "B"...

14
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.460
Congratulations to your government,

15
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.419
business, or terror cell on its acquisition

16
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.699
of the NX-5 Planet Remover by Xamaxax

17
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.249
in partnership with Wrangler jeans.

18
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.579
The NX-5's industry-leading tachyon beams

19
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.219
eliminate planets twice as fast as the NX-4S

20
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.704
with half the battery and zero built-in fatal design flaws.

21
00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:51.259
That's right. No more secret hole

22
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.779
that blows the whole thing up when you shoot it.

23
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.219
Your enemies will say it's unfair.

24
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.099
- We say it's about time. - Damn it.

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.419
We risked our lives for that?

26
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.539
You did your best. Maybe you need a break.

27
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.379
- Don't you ever miss Earth? - I don't have to miss it.

28
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.919
I'm technically still there.

29
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.718
My dad made a perfect clone of me to take my place.

30
00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.659
Boy, that Rick. So, if you do go back,

31
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.959
what happens to the clone?

32
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.339
Does it have, like, a proximity-triggered device

33
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.284
- in its neck? - Who cares? Are we done?

34
00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:16.139
Sure. Unless you want me to remove

35
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.540
the proximity-triggered device from your neck.

36
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.937
Think it's a bomb?

37
00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:22.539
Man, what if this is how you found out

38
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.200
he never wanted you back,

39
00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:26.463
that he loved the clone more than you?

40
00:01:26.464 --> 00:01:28.207
How crazy would that be?

41
00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:30.074
Crazy and of... of course soul-crushing.

42
00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:32.160
For you. I actually have something for that.

43
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.999
Y-You want some? They're nonaddictive.

44
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.679
That's not true. They're totally addictive.

45
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.879
I'm a terrible doctor.

46
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.268
I actually have something for that, too.

47
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.057
You want some? Nonaddictive. Mmm.

48
00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:42.429
I'm a great doctor.

49
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:16.227
Dr. Wong had a cancellation today.

50
00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:17.619
Anybody up for a family session?

51
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.659
- I could do that. - I'm... I'm down to clown.

52
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.539
Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet will be done in time.

53
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.233
Great, because she specifically asked you

54
00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:24.062
to stop bringing puppets. Dad?

55
00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:26.499
I love therapy, family therapy most of all,

56
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.139
- but I am actually disintegrating. - Whoa!

57
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.229
- Oh, my God! - Dad!

58
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.944
Is that really it? We did it?

59
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:34.365
It's the invisibility belt.

60
00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.769
Whoa-whoa-whoa! He grazed them.

61
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.787
That's gonna hurt in like 10 seconds. Thanks, Morty.

62
00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:41.178
Why should I let you use it?

63
00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.116
- You never let me use it. - Can I have the belt?

64
00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:44.219
It would really piss off Morty.

65
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.709
- Fantastic idea. - What the hell?!

66
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.918
You jerk! Give it!

67
00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.129
Hey! Ow!

68
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.840
Share the invisibility. Jerry?

69
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.382
Ooh, this looks like a job for Mr. Nibbles.

70
00:02:52.383 --> 00:02:53.800
Let me just glue one more eye on.

71
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:55.927
I'm gonna kill you!

72
00:02:55.928 --> 00:02:57.529
Woof. Looks like you two have to fight

73
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.039
about why you can't control your kids.

74
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.698
Good thing Dr. Wong's got an opening.

75
00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.379
Bye.

76
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.810
- You're a bad father. - Don't let him divide us.

77
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.507
Garage, family therapy mode.

78
00:03:08.508 --> 00:03:09.950
Ah.

79
00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:15.739
- Honey, you're back. - You seem surprised.

80
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.742
- You never wrote. - And never exploded?

81
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.246
What I'm hearing is that you think that's a bomb.

82
00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:26.082
So does every engineer that's seen it.

83
00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:28.019
Engineer? Princess, I'm sure every caveman

84
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.099
that sees a microwave calls it a rock cabinet.

85
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.290
The point of inventing is to make things that don't exist.

86
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.460
Then whip me up a reason not to kill you.

87
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.607
Dad? We're off to Dr. Wong's.

88
00:03:41.608 --> 00:03:44.179
Scan her.

89
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.352
Dad?

90
00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.077
Okay, have fun, pumpkin.

91
00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:49.606
Sorry I'm a piece-of-[BLEEP] father.

92
00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:52.714
Oh, ha-ha! Well, the self-loathing buys a lot back.

93
00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:53.719
Jerry, leave the puppet.

94
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.427
It's a one-way ticket to a breakthrough, Beth.

95
00:03:56.428 --> 00:03:58.457
The device in her neck would have transferred

96
00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:00.219
a database of her memories to your device

97
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.420
before vaporizing her.

98
00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:02.703
So much for that plan.

99
00:04:02.704 --> 00:04:04.479
Why is she... it...

100
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.899
why am I back with Jerry?

101
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.199
I thought she was a copy of me.

102
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.479
She is a copy of you.

103
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.579
If she ran back to that dingleberry, that's on you.

104
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.599
Want to grab a drink?

105
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.006
- All the time. - Good girl.

106
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.020
Ooh.

107
00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:33.901
- To catch a predator. - What the hell?!

108
00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:35.439
Thermal goggles, bitch.

109
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.528
Mom said share.

110
00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:38.867
You can't share invisibility. Take those off.

111
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.380
No.

112
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.359
So I'll just see you at cheerleader practice?

113
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.369
Should I bring a poncho?

114
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.399
All right!

115
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.459
- State your terms. - Give back the belt.

116
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.219
You take the goggles. Go away.

117
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.421
We trade in an hour.

118
00:04:55.422 --> 00:04:56.817
Deal.

119
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:59.509
How do you like that, bitch?

120
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.830
I liked it more than my old belt.

121
00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.339
"Tiny Big Man Junior"?

122
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.720
You shoulda shared.

123
00:05:06.608 --> 00:05:07.934
What are you doing in my house?

124
00:05:07.935 --> 00:05:10.874
Did I wander that far from my console?

125
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:13.273
They should put a warning on these things.

126
00:05:13.274 --> 00:05:14.858
So, we overrode the gates,

127
00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:17.117
and the slave rebellion took the capital.

128
00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:18.900
- Pretty cool. - Very cool.

129
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.614
My daughter, having space adventures.

130
00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:24.885
They are skewing a tad "Star Wars"-y, though.

131
00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:26.411
Don't forget to have fun.

132
00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:28.157
Well, I came back to murder you, not get your notes,

133
00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:30.415
but I'll remember to fart more while I'm saving the galaxy.

134
00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:32.447
Okay, I'm the one that made this possible.

135
00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:33.751
It's not a competition.

136
00:05:33.752 --> 00:05:35.458
Of course not. Just curious, though, if it were,

137
00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:37.548
would "most wanted" be first place?

138
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.384
You're fighting the Gromflomites?

139
00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:43.052
Dad, they're trying to take over the galaxy!

140
00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:45.394
Everybody in the galaxy tries to take over the galaxy.

141
00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:47.975
The trick is to be left alone by whoever succeeds.

142
00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:49.867
Eh, it's your hero phase.

143
00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.694
I had one, too. You'll outgrow it.

144
00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:54.194
No, you did. I'm not gonna outgrow giving a [BLEEP].

145
00:05:54.195 --> 00:05:55.732
Sources tell us these aliens,

146
00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:58.619
who call themselves the Neeeew Galactic Federation,

147
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.379
will blow up the planet unless some woman

148
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.639
with a very boring name gives herself up.

149
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.239
- Oh, come on. - Way to give a [BLEEP].

150
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.074
Next time, don't wipe it on your home planet.

151
00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:06.911
Oh, [BLEEP]. They're gonna track down Beth.

152
00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:08.779
You mean... Beth's clone.

153
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.439
Right. Beth's clone.

154
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.250
What... What did I say?

155
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.130
It really was nice seeing you again.

156
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:22.799
- Whoo! Yeah! - Go, Honey Bees!

157
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.439
Good practice, girls.

158
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.504
And remember, we are in a drought,

159
00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:28.100
so be sure to shower as one big group

160
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.433
at the exact same time.

161
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.407
Shower fire! The shower's on fire!

162
00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:35.313
Step aside, girls! I got this!

163
00:06:41.153 --> 00:06:42.609
You're a monster!

164
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.640
Still wanna share?

165
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.699
Morty Smith, hands up.

166
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.719
You are under arrest

167
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.399
for crimes against the New Improved Galactic Federation.

168
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.043
Wait. What? How are you doing that?

169
00:06:58.044 --> 00:06:59.319
You're not a psychic, are you?

170
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.464
Do you have psychic powers?

171
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.049
- Uh, yes. - Are they strong powers?

172
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.739
We're just looking for your mother.

173
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.636
You can't, like, stop our hearts, can you?

174
00:07:06.637 --> 00:07:09.009
- Uh, I can. - Okay, we surrender.

175
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.299
Jerry, do you agree that the use of puppets

176
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.142
makes you seem dumb and crazy?

177
00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:16.646
I don't think "crazy" is a responsible word to use in...

178
00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:17.919
It is now. This is crazy.

179
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.060
You're being crazy.

180
00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:20.692
They do it in therapy on TV.

181
00:07:20.693 --> 00:07:23.362
Well, TV gives British people prizes for baking, Jerry.

182
00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:30.536
- Tonya? - Tammy? Tammya? Tammya.

183
00:07:30.537 --> 00:07:31.819
Hi, Mrs. Smith.

184
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.439
I like your hair better this way.

185
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.467
- How's the stomach? - What?

186
00:07:35.468 --> 00:07:37.699
Hey! I only said "hey."

187
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.570
It's not like I can do more than that.

188
00:07:39.578 --> 00:07:41.169
As much as I'd like to kill you,

189
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.881
my superiors have some questions about the Defiance.

190
00:07:43.882 --> 00:07:47.347
I don't have a... I have a Defiance?

191
00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:49.220
Oh, God, I'm a clone.

192
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.680
That's your defense?

193
00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:52.679
No, my defense is eat me.

194
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.279
Hey! Ah! We've been over this.

195
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.604
All I do is say "hey."

196
00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:00.919
Smart guns, white-list human life.

197
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.019
And the therapist.

198
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.760
Tammy, this is the office

199
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.451
where my family works to better itself.

200
00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:12.617
What, and that makes it sacred?

201
00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:14.279
No, it makes it a place I've rigged with a lot

202
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.219
of voice-activated escape contingencies.

203
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.919
These are all good points.

204
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.620
I need to take a long look at myself.

205
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.250
Aah! Aah!

206
00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:24.544
I'd like to discuss that.

207
00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.639
I don't discuss problems, I incinerate them.

208
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.027
Everybody in the car.

209
00:08:29.028 --> 00:08:30.999
Everybody in my family, not the world.

210
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.223
Jesus, Wong. Boundaries.

211
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.250
I'm better than this job.

212
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.648
Can't you just make a portal?

213
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:44.723
Your children are down there invisible, Jerry.

214
00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.787
"Make a portal"? Father of the year back here.

215
00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:47.832
Well, you're one to talk.

216
00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:49.238
You told me I wasn't a clone.

217
00:08:49.239 --> 00:08:50.988
Y-You're not a clone.

218
00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:53.994
- And who is that? - Uh, uh, a clone.

219
00:08:58.415 --> 00:08:59.997
Why would you make a clone of me

220
00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.667
just to send the clone into space?

221
00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:03.318
Well, you didn't want to go, and I thought,

222
00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:04.479
"Okay, that's cool."

223
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.579
But then I thought, "Well,

224
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.779
you know what would be even cooler

225
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.919
is a space daughter," s-so I made one.

226
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.019
And I put a bomb in her neck in case she ever came back.

227
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.179
- Father of the year. - She wasn't supposed to come back.

228
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.339
- Why did she? - Well, she found a bomb in her neck.

229
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.892
Wouldn't you?

230
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.819
- Father of the year. - Shut up!

231
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.319
I'm tired of believing you.

232
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.879
- I want to talk to her. - No, you don't.

233
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.775
- Jerry, do something. - Hey.

234
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.656
He told me you're the clone.

235
00:09:31.657 --> 00:09:33.114
What do you think he told me?

236
00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:34.155
You're the clone?

237
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.868
Wow, naive and attractive.

238
00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:37.662
Wow, jaded and hot.

239
00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:41.759
I know this is bad parenting, but if you stop fighting,

240
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.042
you both get McDonald's.

241
00:09:43.043 --> 00:09:45.545
How about I just blow my brains out, starting with hers?

242
00:09:45.546 --> 00:09:47.097
Okay, Wendy's. We love Wendy's.

243
00:09:47.098 --> 00:09:48.841
- I-I think they even gave us some money. - Drop it.

244
00:09:48.842 --> 00:09:50.467
- Don't move! - Freeze! Get down!

245
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.519
- On the ground! On the ground! - Don't move!

246
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.959
Everybody, shut up! You're all saying different [BLEEP].

247
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.015
- Wait, so there are two of them? - More importantly,

248
00:09:57.016 --> 00:09:58.338
which one is mine?

249
00:09:58.339 --> 00:09:59.892
Uh, neither, chauvinist.

250
00:09:59.893 --> 00:10:01.499
Whatever. Take them both.

251
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.799
Cool beam. But let's bargain.

252
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.861
I'm the one you really want.

253
00:10:08.862 --> 00:10:11.497
- Excuse me? - Uh, smartest man in the universe?

254
00:10:11.498 --> 00:10:13.139
Secret to interdimensional travel?

255
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.154
Ask your bosses.

256
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:15.460
My bosses are bugs, Rick.

257
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.919
You killed the old ones. The new ones are half my age.

258
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.581
They know if you're left alone, you're a non-threat.

259
00:10:21.582 --> 00:10:23.478
- Oofa! - We got the payload.

260
00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:25.159
Fire up the NX-5.

261
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.340
Earth's going Ta-ta.

262
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.579
You might want to do that thing

263
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.840
where you find a new universe

264
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.437
where you can [BLEEP] yourself off.

265
00:10:30.438 --> 00:10:31.549
You can't tell me what to do.

266
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.398
Awesome. He resisted. We can shoot him.

267
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.759
- Wha? - Just go with it, Jerry.

268
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.419
Everybody, drop your guns... except for Jerry!

269
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.859
[BLEEP] classic.

270
00:10:44.396 --> 00:10:46.107
- Holy [BLEEP]. Morty. - And Summer.

271
00:10:46.108 --> 00:10:48.023
W-We worked together. That's... that's our arc.

272
00:10:48.024 --> 00:10:49.119
We went from siblings

273
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.568
to invisible to working together.

274
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:52.399
It's not "Citizen Kane," but why compete

275
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.696
with whatever's going on here, you know?

276
00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:56.366
Unh!

277
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.070
Aah!

278
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.779
You made me go to a wedding.

279
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.039
And you killed my best friend. I shoulda said that one first.

280
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.959
Congratulations, Earth,

281
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.067
on being destroyed by the NX-5,

282
00:11:11.068 --> 00:11:14.175
brought to you by Wrangler.

283
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.829
Ugh, guess the galaxy's most-wanted mammal

284
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.859
needs her daddy to come change her diapie.

285
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.638
Come on, kids, we have to go do

286
00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:26.146
a [BLEEP] piece of [BLEEP] "Star Wars."

287
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.150
Attention, Zeta 99-2.

288
00:11:31.151 --> 00:11:33.403
We know you have a stolen ship. Stand down.

289
00:11:33.404 --> 00:11:35.600
Oh, am I not a non-threat now?

290
00:11:44.289 --> 00:11:45.867
Hey, you are not cleared to land.

291
00:11:45.868 --> 00:11:47.959
- We will open fire. - Hold your ground, men.

292
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.800
You'll be heroes.

293
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.769
Summer, try unlocking that door

294
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.628
by scanning your high-school friend's dead face.

295
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.100
Uh, I have... I have to pee.

296
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.863
Pee on the floor. It's a Death Star.

297
00:11:58.864 --> 00:12:00.359
Okay, but there's rebellion

298
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.999
- and then there's... - Here, Dad.

299
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.929
Perfect.

300
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.685
What am I doing wrong?

301
00:12:05.686 --> 00:12:08.167
Ugh, her eyes are closed. Morty, open the left one.

302
00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:09.815
I've got the right.

303
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.940
She died the way she lived, overserialized.

304
00:12:12.943 --> 00:12:14.216
I'm gonna rescue your mom and her clone

305
00:12:14.217 --> 00:12:15.328
without revealing which is which.

306
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.347
You two find the NX-5 and shut it down.

307
00:12:17.348 --> 00:12:19.017
I mean, don't die trying. There's infinite Earths.

308
00:12:19.018 --> 00:12:20.677
If you can save this one, it's gravy.

309
00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:22.119
Dream team rides again!

310
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.847
Oh, yeah, we're like Luke and Leia.

311
00:12:23.848 --> 00:12:25.169
Uh, except no kissing part.

312
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.539
What's another famous brother-sister team?

313
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.549
Uh, Hansel and Gretel?

314
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.208
Yeah, right, those two were [BLEEP].

315
00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:30.419
Dad, we need the belt.

316
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.889
I can't go with you guys watching.

317
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.159
- You're invisible. - What if the pee isn't?

318
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.219
You know what? We don't need invisibility.

319
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.949
Working together is our belt.

320
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.379
- That's our arc. Let's do it. - I'm gonna go ahead and whistle.

321
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.579
That's how good I feel.

322
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.250
Oh, God. I knew it.

323
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.679
Ugh, this floor isn't level.

324
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.679
Are they gonna torture us?

325
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.821
Unless you plan on telling them what I know.

326
00:12:58.822 --> 00:13:00.656
Last chance to guess who was the clone.

327
00:13:00.657 --> 00:13:02.087
You're his daughter.

328
00:13:02.088 --> 00:13:03.499
Just something about the eyes,

329
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.163
the shameless abandonment of your family.

330
00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:08.279
However can I live with myself?

331
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.969
One theory... I was designed by your father to live with myself,

332
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.519
which would mean you made a conscious choice

333
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.044
to swallow your dreams with cheap wine and dinosaur pasta.

334
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.698
You know that's the kind Jerry likes,

335
00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:19.007
same way I know the only goddamn dream you'll ever follow

336
00:13:19.008 --> 00:13:20.384
is your shitty father's approval.

337
00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:22.407
You fetch your shitty father's lemonade.

338
00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:24.438
You cosplay as your shitty father in his 30s.

339
00:13:24.439 --> 00:13:25.939
Red alert. Red alert.

340
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.940
Rick Sanchez...

341
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.934
More like dead alert. What else? What else?

342
00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:31.299
I wrote some stuff down in my Notes app.

343
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.547
Let me just find it.

344
00:13:33.548 --> 00:13:36.214
Screw it. Beth, if... if one of you is still alive,

345
00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:37.219
you're my real daughter.

346
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.071
If you're both alive, don't hurt the other one.

347
00:13:39.072 --> 00:13:40.964
She's just a clone. She's not worth it.

348
00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:41.999
I'm coming, baby.

349
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.241
- That piece of [BLEEP]. - That piece of [BLEEP].

350
00:13:44.242 --> 00:13:46.078
I came back kill him, you know.

351
00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.787
I'd like to help.

352
00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:49.914
- Kick me between my eyes. - From here?

353
00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:51.239
Oh, you dropped yoga so you could buy

354
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.659
Jerry more Flintstones Vitam...

355
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.960
Oh, I do not like the looks of this giant fight chamber.

356
00:14:06.556 --> 00:14:09.407
- Bird Person? - It is now Phoenix Person.

357
00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:10.559
You're working for them?

358
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.144
What did they do to you, BP?

359
00:14:12.145 --> 00:14:14.599
It is now PP. Where is Tammy?

360
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.200
Oh, don't worry about her. I killed her.

361
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.609
I loved her.

362
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.279
Really? Huh. Then can I suggest, as an alternate name,

363
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.900
Crazy [BLEEP] Whipped Person?

364
00:14:22.906 --> 00:14:24.279
Aah!

365
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.658
Unh!

366
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.330
Aah!

367
00:14:37.254 --> 00:14:38.579
It's funny.

368
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.589
I always wondered who would win if we ever fought.

369
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.737
Then you were always a bad friend.

370
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.931
Aah!

371
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.620
Morty, we had one grenade.

372
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.354
- He had a gun. - Whatever. Come on.

373
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.679
- Did you hear something? - Doesn't matter.

374
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.483
If anyone's around, they're here to stop the laser,

375
00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:01.087
and they can't do it without us seeing them.

376
00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:02.839
"Working together is our belt"?

377
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.859
You gave it away!

378
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.879
You said we didn't need it.

379
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.949
I wish you were never born.

380
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:06.950
You were an accident.

381
00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.339
How come some of the pants are...

382
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.619
The NX-5 can't destroy Wrangler jeans.

383
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.663
Like, it literally can't destroy them

384
00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:15.919
or it's programmed not to?

385
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.870
Gee, what do you think?

386
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.199
You kill a good bug, for a horse doctor.

387
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.459
Thanks, me.

388
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.019
Maybe we could do, like, a "Parent Trap" thing together sometime.

389
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.617
As long as you mean the Lindsay Lohan version.

390
00:15:57.618 --> 00:15:58.740
Naturally.

391
00:16:01.046 --> 00:16:03.199
What do you think they do with all those jeans?

392
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.560
- Make them into jackets? - It's not about conserving denim.

393
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.789
It's marketing. Like, uh, "The NX-5 destroys the whole planet

394
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.339
except for the Wrangler jeans."

395
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.780
Because they're so tough. Tougher than the laser?

396
00:16:12.788 --> 00:16:14.685
- Stupid. - You're talking about it.

397
00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:16.499
Mm, you're right. They... they got me.

398
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.659
Hey, over here. Look at me.

399
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.679
Did you just see a pantsless little boy run by?

400
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.855
I'm not falling for that again.

401
00:16:20.857 --> 00:16:22.692
I used to be invisible, but now I'm the opposite.

402
00:16:22.693 --> 00:16:24.119
Get him. But not in a weird way.

403
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.190
You made it weird.

404
00:16:31.493 --> 00:16:33.779
NX-5 corporate sponsor detected.

405
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.419
Cannot penetrate Wranglers.

406
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.455
Built too tough.

407
00:16:36.456 --> 00:16:39.230
Built... too... tough.

408
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.059
I killed them! I-I did... I did it offscreen.

409
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.239
God damn it. Morty, fix your underwear.

410
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.560
I saw your balls for a second.

411
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:46.749
That's on you.

412
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.399
Why can't I meet your parents?

413
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.799
- Are you embarrassed of me? - No, of them.

414
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.887
Aww.

415
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:01.600
Unh... ahh!

416
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.299
Never thought this was how I'd die.

417
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.679
We're nowhere near Venice,

418
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.160
and you're not a dwarf in a raincoat.

419
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.099
Step back. You're not killing him

420
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.000
till we kick his ass, Bird Person.

421
00:17:21.001 --> 00:17:23.085
My name is Phoenix Person.

422
00:17:23.086 --> 00:17:24.587
No one's calling you that. Dumb.

423
00:17:24.588 --> 00:17:26.679
It fascinates me that an entire family

424
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.749
can be this critical and suck this much.

425
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.719
Aah!

426
00:17:41.855 --> 00:17:44.069
Aah!

427
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.524
Bird Person, stop.

428
00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:47.979
It's me, that Tammy girl.

429
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.399
Tammy, this is unexpected.

430
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.864
I was told you were dead.

431
00:17:51.865 --> 00:17:54.887
That is ab-so-lute-ly not true.

432
00:17:54.888 --> 00:17:57.870
I'm more alive than I've ever been.

433
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:00.159
You are behaving rather strangely.

434
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.597
Me? Strange? Oh, my.

435
00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:04.168
Well, who's normal, really?

436
00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:06.967
Now, come here, you big hollow-boned featherhead.

437
00:18:06.968 --> 00:18:09.267
Let me give you some of this sweet ass.

438
00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:20.147
Saved the day with puppeting.

439
00:18:20.148 --> 00:18:21.477
Only one with a decent arc.

440
00:18:21.478 --> 00:18:23.187
He does have his moments.

441
00:18:23.188 --> 00:18:24.287
Mom, Dad!

442
00:18:24.288 --> 00:18:26.187
Mom. Uh, we did it!

443
00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:27.899
Morty became super visible!

444
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.569
Summer put my jeans in a laser!

445
00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:31.688
Morty, look at your little balls!

446
00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:34.782
- I know! - Bring it in here, guys.

447
00:18:34.783 --> 00:18:36.909
Damn, this thing has twin turbines?

448
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.449
I'll forgive you for abandoning us if you let me drive it.

449
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.747
That works for me... I was just gonna give you space cigarettes.

450
00:18:41.748 --> 00:18:42.847
I love having two moms.

451
00:18:42.848 --> 00:18:44.489
And I love having two wives.

452
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.501
Never gonna happen, Jerry.

453
00:18:45.502 --> 00:18:47.317
You jerk-offs ready to get the answers

454
00:18:47.318 --> 00:18:48.713
to your burning questions?

455
00:18:48.714 --> 00:18:49.920
What's this, Dad?

456
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.249
The memory of which Beth is real

457
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.050
and which Beth is a clone, obviously.

458
00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:55.439
You mind-blew yourself? You...

459
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.079
You literally don't even know which of your daughters is real.

460
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.799
Of course you don't. Why am I surprised?

461
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.499
I'm sure you'd love for us to need that from you,

462
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.300
but I don't care what's in that vial.

463
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.379
Yeah, me neither.

464
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.562
You're a piece of [BLEEP] either way.

465
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:08.691
So what? After all this, you don't want to know the truth?

466
00:19:08.692 --> 00:19:10.899
The truth is we have more important [BLEEP] to do

467
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.230
like raise our kids and stamp out the Federation,

468
00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:16.838
neither of which seem like they want anything to do with you.

469
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.619
Morty? Sum-Sum?

470
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.678
You gotta at least wanna know who your real mom is.

471
00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:25.199
Not really, Rick. We have two badass moms now.

472
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.676
- It's... That's kind of a win/win. - Yeah, Grandpa Rick,

473
00:19:26.677 --> 00:19:27.959
don't drag us into your bull[BLEEP]

474
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.046
just because you're losing control.

475
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.339
I know what I want to do.

476
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.249
- I want you to decide. - What?

477
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.723
For once in my life, I want you to decide, Dad.

478
00:19:40.724 --> 00:19:43.194
Do you want me to stay here and be part of your life,

479
00:19:43.195 --> 00:19:44.436
or do you want me to leave?

480
00:20:00.493 --> 00:20:02.911
_

481
00:20:09.128 --> 00:20:12.060
Hup! Ho! Big money, big money.

482
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.439
Eyes on the lady.

483
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.458
Switcheroo. Which one's which?

484
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.299
Holy shit. I'm a terrible father.

485
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.360
At least I'm a pretty good friend.

486
00:20:29.138 --> 00:20:31.274
Looks like it's just you and me, buddy.

487
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.327
Okay, all right, we'll give you a little more time.

488
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.875
Ah, goodbye, old friend.

489
00:21:31.876 --> 00:21:35.180
We've had our fun, but I'm ready to be seen again.

490
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.449
What the [BLEEP]?!

491
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.052
- Oh, my God! Where did I go? - Oh, shitskis.

492
00:21:42.053 --> 00:21:43.429
Aah!

493
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.559
Slow down! There's an invisible garbage truck

494
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.010
- in the road! - Yeah, right.

495
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.429
I'm alive. I survi...

496
00:21:56.901 --> 00:21:59.979
I mean, when in Rome.

497
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.239
âª Invisible Garbage Truck Jerry âª

498
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.519
âª It's a new franchise âª

499
00:22:08.288 --> 00:22:11.582
Bitch, your job is to have intercourse with strangers

500
00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:12.879
and give me the money.

501
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.818
Sorry I called you a bitch, it's a vocational term.

502
00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:16.519
It's not how I feel about you personally.

503
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.898
What the... what... what... aah!

504
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.290
Aah!

505
00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:21.717
Somebody call for a pickup?

506
00:22:21.718 --> 00:22:23.987
Let's go take out the trash.

507
00:22:23.988 --> 00:22:27.087
âª Invisible Garbage Truck Jerry âª

508
00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:29.557
âª It's a new franchise âª

âª Until he runs out of gas âª

510
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.950
Well, we had a good run.
