1
00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:13.137
Step away from the Tarnation Casket, Baron Thistle.

2
00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.597
You cannot stop me, Arbor Knight.

3
00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.474
Once the stream is activated,

4
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.395
the negative feedback will rip your world apart.

5
00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.648
We have 1.32 minutes before the...

6
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:25.858
What the fuck is happening?

7
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.234
Are you following any of this?

8
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.360
I'm so lost.

9
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.987
Should we turn the subtitles back on?

10
00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.363
-Shh! -...nano-configuration,

11
00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.991
causing the Tarnation Casket to self-implode.

12
00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.325
But that's impossible!

13
00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.660
Nothing's impossible.

14
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.620
We're the Robo-Trees.

15
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.873
You're Arbor Knight, our leader.

16
00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.042
Red Wood, you're the hothead.

17
00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.378
Palme D'or, you're our resident super-genius.

18
00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.214
Cypress, you're our girl boss boss-lady.

19
00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:55.262
And I'm Tannenbaum, here to get your rears in gear. Whoo.

20
00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.389
Did he seriously reintroduce each character?

21
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.850
-This is the ninth movie. -Die, Tannenbaum! You suck!

22
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.228
Guys, you're talking over the whole ending.

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.526
This is not over, Robo-Trees.

24
00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:14.323
Your day of reckoning will soon be at hand.

25
00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.534
Don't just stand there, Red Wood. He's still in range. Shoot him!

26
00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:19.244
You're literally holding a gun.

27
00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.081
Robo-Trees, let's go home.

28
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.292
Yeah. I need a bath.

29
00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.711
'Cause I'm stinky.

30
00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.505
It's a Maximum Velocitree...

31
00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.091
Ugh. Not exactly Citizen Kane.

32
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.717
I kinda loved it.

33
00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:36.012
Oh, God. Rick! What are you doing?

34
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.430
I don't know what to do with these feelings, Jerry.

35
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.057
This used to be my favorite franchise.

36
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.934
Maybe it's time to like something else.

37
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.270
No! I wanna talk to the manager.

38
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.776
-You in charge? -Yeah.

39
00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.153
I'm James Gunn.

40
00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.822
Hey! Bradley Cooper carved that desk.

41
00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.282
What was up with that last Maximum Velocitree?

42
00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.409
-You didn't like it? -I thought it was great.

43
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.162
You're ruining my childhood. Which is still ongoing.

44
00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.957
Stop eating up screen time with stupid comic relief characters

45
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.085
and put more cool shit in the story!

46
00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.294
Guys, I'm a fan too.

47
00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.172
Why do you think Warner Bros. put me behind that desk you now owe me?

48
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.841
So you could pitch Batman ideas to yourself?

49
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.050
Exactly.

50
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.260
And you know what I've learned?

51
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.637
Making movies isn't easy.

52
00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:22.266
The next Maximum Velocitree movie has been rewritten 40 times.

53
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.392
Thirty by me.

54
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.061
Now, we'll spend five years and half a billion making it,

55
00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:29.022
but in the end, know what will make fans like you like it?

56
00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:30.983
-A fucking miracle. -No.

57
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.569
What the next Maximum Velocitree film needs is us.

58
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.237
I'd like to see you try...

59
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.656
-Hey! -Time to fix this broken franchise.

60
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.283
Good luck doing anything with that script.

61
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.577
It's watermarked!

62
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.125
I'll get an Uber.

63
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.325
I don't know, this script is pretty good.

64
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:24.204
-Give that back, Dad. -Whoa, what's that?

65
00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.122
The Movie-lizer.

66
00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.749
It makes movies at the speed of thought.

67
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.667
I invented it during the title sequence.

68
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.337
Let's see what James Gunn had cookin'.

69
00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.220
For the honor of the Robo-Tree.

70
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.680
Time to die.

71
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.933
With the power of friendship!

72
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.810
Yikes. Citizen Kane doesn't strike again.

73
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:50.187
Oh, he will.

74
00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.689
The Movie-lizer uses a prompt-driven CPU.

75
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.484
I just type whatever tweaks I want, and it auto-generates the rest.

76
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.653
Hell yeah. Make it lose that bad guy.

77
00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.988
Baron Thistle hasn't been cool since the third movie.

78
00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.533
Let's kill two birds with one prompt.

79
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.661
Till we meet again, Robo-Trees.

80
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.039
Wait. Where did this gun come from?

81
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.749
Whoopsie.

82
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.042
Hey. That man was unarmed.

83
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.586
Yeah, man. Uncool.

84
00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.672
It was an accident.

85
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:20.176
-So awesome. They hate him. -Here. Watch this.

86
00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:23.220
I sentence you to life in prison

87
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.931
for unlicensed murder.

88
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.225
Oh, please.

89
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.227
Isn't some of the stuff you're messing with important?

90
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.728
Oh, fuck the fuck off, Jerry.

91
00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.147
That formula-driven, "Save the Cat" bullshit

92
00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:35.482
is what killed the last couple of movies.

93
00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.566
That's right, Morty.

94
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.485
We're gonna make the people care about the Robo-Trees again.

95
00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:42.115
Movie-lizer, make us care.

96
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:56.128
Where are we?

97
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.172
Oh, shit. Morty, look.

98
00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:00.674
Oh my God.

99
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.969
It's Robo-Tree Headquarters.

100
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.805
Wait, how... how is this happening?

101
00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.725
-Intruders! -Let's go.

102
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.185
Stop them.

103
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.314
Fuck. The Movie-lizer Last Action Hero'd us.

104
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.441
We're characters in the movie now, Morty.

105
00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.943
-It hurts. -Are you guys okay?

106
00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.820
I mean, I can see you're being shot at.

107
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.071
Dad? Holy shit,

108
00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:25.157
I can hear your internal dialogue in my head.

109
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.992
Is the machine supposed to work like this?

110
00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.910
No. The Movie-lizer malfunctioned.

111
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:30.954
Now the Robo-Trees are trying to kill us.

112
00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.541
Really? Uh, let me try something.

113
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.586
-What the hell is this? -A 2007 Kia Spectra.

114
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.421
I thought you could use a cool getaway car.

115
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.215
-Are you kidding me? This car sucks. -The joke's on you.

116
00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:44.551
Edmunds Car Report gave it three stars.

117
00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.636
It's a family sedan! Shoot it!

118
00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:48.264
Better than nothing. Let's go.

119
00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.019
How are we gonna get outta here?

120
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.605
The Movie-lizer might eject us once the story is over.

121
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.232
Jerry, type that we skip to the end, and everything works out.

122
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.109
I don't think I can, guys.

123
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.196
It says the script is 3,000 pages and counting.

124
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.365
Also, there's an error-thing bleeping that says,

125
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.242
"antagonist not found" and "no third act."

126
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.745
Without an ending, you'll be stuck in the movie forever.

127
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.080
God damn it.

128
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.123
You cut a bunch of stuff out willy-nilly.

129
00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:16.833
What did you expect?

130
00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:19.795
Look, I understand story. Let me just put everything back

131
00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.171
-that you took out and... -Jerry, stop.

132
00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.340
You'll only make things worse. You're a terrible writer,

133
00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.842
and you should never, ever get on the keys.

134
00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:27.552
Well, excuse me for living.

135
00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.805
Alright, we killed the villain, gotta undo that.

136
00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.182
Didn't they use lightning to bring George Washington back to life

137
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.393
in Maximum VelociThree: Tell No Lies?

138
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.770
Hold on. The machine doesn't hate that...

139
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.230
See? This is going to work.

140
00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.150
We'll bring back Baron Thistle and give this stupid thing an ending.

141
00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.654
Use your blinker! Fuck off!

142
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.869
Okay, all we need now is a little lightning.

143
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.755
-We're back, baby! -It worked.

144
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.049
Look out! Zombie!

145
00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:08.969
Dude. We just brought him back.

146
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.095
Fucker bit you.

147
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.640
Wait! The Movie-lizer is detecting a new antagonist.

148
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.767
I don't see any...

149
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.897
Guys, this new character has given you

150
00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:23.859
a 20.5% better chance of ending the movie.

151
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.279
-But I am in pain. -So we're back on course?

152
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.573
Sort of. You still need a third act.

153
00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.700
In the original draft, Baron Thistle was gonna

154
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.162
kill Tannenbaum in front of the Robo-Trees...

155
00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:36.065
That would've been a cool ending.

156
00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:40.460
Maybe Son of Thistle could finish what his father started?

157
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.586
You do kinda look like him.

158
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.087
You want me to kill Tannenbaum?

159
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.255
Whatever works.

160
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.048
Okay, I'll break Tannenbaum out of jail,

161
00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:49.676
reunite him with the Robo-Trees, and then Morty will kill him.

162
00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:51.511
Does the machine recognize that as an ending?

163
00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:52.847
Hold on.

164
00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:57.017
It does! Kinda bleak, though.

165
00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.977
Shut up. I'm off to a jailbreak.

166
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.896
What the hell am I supposed to do?

167
00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.147
You're the new bad guy.

168
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.940
Hook up with the Hench-Weeds and give the Robo-Trees

169
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.066
something to stop.

170
00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.945
-Something to stop? What's that mean? -See you in the third act!

171
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.369
Extra creatine, please.

172
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.538
-Yo, James Gunn. -Oh. Hi, Zack Snyder.

173
00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:21.291
Just saw your new cut of Superman, and word of advice,

174
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.002
he's the Man of Steel, not the Man of Conversation.

175
00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:26.213
-Okay. -Do more shots of him punching.

176
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.131
And here's a secret move.

177
00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:29.883
Start the punch at regular speed,

178
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.468
and then you're gonna ramp it down.

179
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.262
It's not a fucking secret!

180
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.263
I'm sorry, Zack Snyder.

181
00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:38.475
I shouldn't be lashing out at you. Your biceps are the size of my head.

182
00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:42.229
Yes, but so is my heart. What's going on with you?

183
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.316
Some fan of the Velocitree franchise got onto the lot today.

184
00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.485
He used a portal, and he just...

185
00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.530
Zack, we're not losing touch with the audience, are we?

186
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.199
I mean, I gave notes on the goddamn Count Chocula movie

187
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.117
-this morning... -Was the portal green?

188
00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.786
That's Rick Sanchez.

189
00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.955
Gunner, that's the guy that sealed Nolan

190
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.289
in the giant bookcase

191
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.542
to quote-unquote punish him for Interstellar.

192
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.168
He doesn't represent real fans.

193
00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:07.379
He's just the smartest man in the universe.

194
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.007
Don't sweat it. He can't do what we do.

195
00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:11.509
Probably.

196
00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.593
Gonna go crush some weights.

197
00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.178
One day you're gonna wish you hit the gym

198
00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:16.639
like I do, James Gunn.

199
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.480
Hello?

200
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.941
Is this Baron Thistle's evil base?

201
00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.859
Not anymore. We're packing it in.

202
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.114
Gonna try to sell all this stuff on my girlfriend's Etsy site.

203
00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:36.575
Everyone, listen up.

204
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.160
I'm here to get this place back up and running.

205
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:42.122
I am the Son of Thistle!

206
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.040
He does sorta have the same jacket.

207
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:45.959
And his head is also a cactus.

208
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.502
That's all the proof I need!

209
00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:49.130
Tell us what to do.

210
00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:53.091
Well, what were y'all doing before Baron Thistle died?

211
00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.552
Oh. You know. Doomsday plan.

212
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.053
We were gonna melt the ice caps.

213
00:09:57.054 --> 00:09:58.722
Spent months on the blueprints,

214
00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.473
not that your dad ever said, "Thank you."

215
00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:02.475
-What's your name? -Samantha.

216
00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:05.228
It sucks when your boss never says thank you, Samantha.

217
00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:08.524
But under me, everyone will feel appreciated.

218
00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:11.901
Samantha, I am putting you in charge

219
00:10:11.902 --> 00:10:15.656
of Operation: Complete and Total Polar Cap Destruction.

220
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:19.909
Thank you, sir. I've been feeling so low lately.

221
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.953
I think it's 'cause my mom forgot my birthday.

222
00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.664
Samantha, that will never happen again.

223
00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.459
I'm your Mom now.

224
00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.337
Now, let's melt some ice caps!

225
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:36.218
See? My Son of Thistle idea did work.

226
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.554
Son of a bitch did it. He made a movie machine.

227
00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:41.557
Says it right on the side.

228
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:49.981
-Hello? -Hi, there.

229
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.360
It's me. Your wife.

230
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:54.986
Here's your prison food, new guy.

231
00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.196
What you in for?

232
00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.822
The fastest crime I could commit.

233
00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.576
Any of you see an annoying little bitch of a Christmas tree?

234
00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:06.039
Oh, please. Oh, please, don't beat me.

235
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.208
I won't. I'm here to rescue you.

236
00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.710
-I'm not worth rescuing. -Huh?

237
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:13.755
I suck. I say dumb catchphrases.

238
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:17.634
I look like a toy designed for kids.

239
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.803
I'm a fucking idiot.

240
00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.721
Wow. More self-aware than I thought.

241
00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.890
But come on, everyone sucks until they don't.

242
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:25.392
That's the arc of every good story.

243
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:27.560
-It is? -Here's the plan.

244
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:29.312
I'll start a riot and we sneak out.

245
00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:30.563
I know you're not a fighter, but...

246
00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.315
When do we start?

247
00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:33.401
Oh.

248
00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.611
-Right now. -Good.

249
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.698
Take that back, asshole.

250
00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.660
I'll take it back when I stop fucking your mother.

251
00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:46.831
Save some punching for the rest of us.

252
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.459
Lunch is ruined.

253
00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.511
Whoa. Cool.

254
00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:04.056
Get your fucking rear in gear.

255
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.391
I really miss you.

256
00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.934
I miss my hubby.

257
00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:09.561
Why don't you come into the kitchen?

258
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.732
Sure. But why are you calling from a different phone number?

259
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.109
It's a burner phone for spam calls.

260
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.446
Come into the kitchen for some lemonade.

261
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.824
Oh, wow. Can't pass up lemonade.

262
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.076
The Movie-lizer is mine.

263
00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:29.415
No one's more creative than James Gunn.

264
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:38.299
God damn it. We're stuck.

265
00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:40.968
No, we're not, Rick.

266
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:44.012
Grab my stump.

267
00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.348
-Yeah! -Whoa!

268
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.522
Holy shit. That was awesome.

269
00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:56.983
And so was that.

270
00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:58.193
-Whoo-hoo! Yeah! -Job well done.

271
00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.278
-Alright! -Thank the squirrels you're safe!

272
00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.114
Thank Rick Sanchez. He did everything.

273
00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.949
You did a lot too.

274
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.409
Definitely more than I expected.

275
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.914
Rick, I wanna thank you for rescuing me.

276
00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:13.458
Here. I want you to have this.

277
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.667
It's a piece of me.

278
00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:16.628
Oh, thanks.

279
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.421
Is this, like, one of your balls?

280
00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:21.299
Robo-Trees, something messed up is going viral

281
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.802
all over Twit-Tok.

282
00:13:23.552 --> 00:13:26.012
Hello, Earth. I'm the Son of Thistle,

283
00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:29.307
and I'm just like my dad, so I'ma Doomsdayin'.

284
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.518
Samantha, tell the people what we're gonna do.

285
00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:33.478
We're gonna wipe out the polar ice caps

286
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.023
'cause they suck!

287
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:39.527
Does the Movie-lizer still think we're on track?

288
00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:41.570
Jerry?

289
00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:45.032
-Jerry? -It's fuckin' heavy!

290
00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.744
Shoulda listened to Snyder.

291
00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.624
Right on cue.

292
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.669
Weeds, attack!

293
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:01.507
Robo-Trees, let's stomp that prick.

294
00:14:13.894 --> 00:14:15.813
Where the hell is Tannenbaum?

295
00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.360
-Dude, where is he? -On the ship.

296
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.112
Turns out, Tannenbaum's an alright guy.

297
00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:25.593
He's kinda my favorite character now.

298
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.700
What? Look at me! I'm a fucking cactus!

299
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.368
Relax. Trust the process.

300
00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.787
Oh my God, you're re-breaking the story again?

301
00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:35.373
I wanna go home! And I didn't even think

302
00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:37.876
the last Maximum Velocitree was all that bad.

303
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.628
You said it wasn't Citizen Kane.

304
00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:43.006
I'm 14! I've never seen Citizen Kane!

305
00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:45.633
Now, listen to me, you stupid old man!

306
00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:47.677
You're gonna bring Tannenbaum here,

307
00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:49.846
and I'm gonna shoot him in the goddamn head

308
00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.848
just like we planned!

309
00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.226
Okay, okay! I'll help you kill him.

310
00:14:55.352 --> 00:14:57.478
-You're gonna do what? -Mom?

311
00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:59.689
You're in cahoots with the Robo-Trees?

312
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.109
-Samantha, let me explain. -Okay. Go ahead.

313
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.694
Shit, she called my bluff. Run!

314
00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:05.821
Get them!

315
00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:12.911
-Dad, help. -Your dad's not fuckin' answering.

316
00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:16.372
That's because he's in the kitchen, talking to his wife.

317
00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:17.498
-James Gunn? -James Gunn?

318
00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.334
-That's right. -James Gunn?

319
00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:22.003
-Just walk away, man. Walk away. -But...

320
00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:24.172
I read that dinosaur book you wrote, Jerry.

321
00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:26.090
-Really good stuff. -You did?

322
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.010
Well, I got the gist. Maybe we could do business together?

323
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:30.553
Two-picture deal?

324
00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:32.639
-Dad, no! -Don't do it! We need you!

325
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.308
That's it, Jerry. Give in to Hollywood.

326
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.644
You know how to really succeed in this town?

327
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.355
By turning your back on family.

328
00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:41.565
I don't like that.

329
00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.318
No! You could've had it all!

330
00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.070
Guys, I'm back.

331
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:49.989
Jeez Louise, what did you do? The story's gone linear.

332
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.533
We pissed off the good guys and the bad guys.

333
00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:54.160
Rick likes Tannenbaum now.

334
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:56.371
-I just think he's interesting. -We need a new ending.

335
00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:57.997
I literally wrote us into a corner.

336
00:15:57.998 --> 00:15:59.582
You gotta write us outta here, Jerry.

337
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.709
Me? You said I was a terrible writer

338
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.753
who should never, ever, ever, ever, ever...

339
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.755
I didn't say that many "evers." Listen, Jerry.

340
00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:07.924
Any idiot can plug an idea into a machine

341
00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:09.676
when they don't care what it spits back out,

342
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.344
but it takes a special kind of idiot

343
00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:12.971
to get on the keys and write us an ending.

344
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.347
You're that idiot.

345
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:15.431
But how?

346
00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:17.266
It's always been right in front of you.

347
00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:18.477
Go over to my workbench.

348
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.770
Alright. I'm there.

349
00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.981
Open the third drawer on the right and reach way back.

350
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.482
There should be a small orange bottle.

351
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:27.068
What is it? Some sci-fi device?

352
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:29.654
Better. It's magic.

353
00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.364
Don't take more than two, drink lots of water,

354
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:32.741
and remember to blink.

355
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:39.122
I now pronounce you two both guilty and dead.

356
00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:40.999
Aw, jeez. Dad? Help.

357
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.417
Then, as fate would have it,

358
00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:44.545
a very large air vent opened beneath them.

359
00:16:45.212 --> 00:16:47.964
Our heroes escape execution via the large vented air vent.

360
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.341
As fate would have it, this is a direct path to the outside.

361
00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:53.470
Slam cut to exterior: New York, day.

362
00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:55.513
New York?

363
00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:56.889
Why are we in New York?

364
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.266
Stop micromanaging me!

365
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.684
Then, as fate would have it,

366
00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.519
a high-octane Lamborgina pulls up.

367
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.187
Whoopsie, forgot how to drive.

368
00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.356
Here, kid, catch.

369
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.941
Whoa. The Adderall is hittin'.

370
00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:08.485
Get in the car!

371
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.598
Okay, Jerry, now get us to the climax.

372
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:39.933
Nerth Pole?

373
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.518
That's where Samantha built the super weapon!

374
00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:44.687
Dad's trying to get us back on course.

375
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:45.898
Hang on.

376
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.611
Yes! We've got curvature!

377
00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.744
Guessing that's your doomsday weapon.

378
00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.079
We're nearin' the end of the movie.

379
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.747
Damn. Samantha built it fast.

380
00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.082
I guess supporting those beneath you...

381
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.292
Here they come!

382
00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:33.528
We have 1.63 minutes before the melting polar ice caps

383
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.363
reach the point of no return.

384
00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:37.949
-We got company. -Stop that traitor.

385
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.202
Shit, Morty, I think I figured out the best ending yet.

386
00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.204
Hello, Mother.

387
00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.540
You deal with that. I don't know what that's about.

388
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.334
Come and get me, trees.

389
00:18:48.043 --> 00:18:51.546
Samantha, hey. Beautiful job on the weapon thing.

390
00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.090
I thought you actually liked my evil plan.

391
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.634
But let's face it, you're no mother.

392
00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.345
You're just a bad guy.

393
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.264
Step away from that super weapon.

394
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:04.601
-Let's blast him. -For once, I agree with you.

395
00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:09.772
Stop! Don't shoot! He's a good man!

396
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:11.482
He saved me.

397
00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.442
-No. I'm bad. -Huh?

398
00:19:13.443 --> 00:19:15.611
I only rescued you so I could have you killed.

399
00:19:15.612 --> 00:19:19.115
I hate you, Tannenbaum. You look like a toy.

400
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.951
-Die already! -Gun!

401
00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:27.039
See you... next... summer.

402
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.920
Wait. No. No!

403
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.931
You saved the world from another unarmed man.

404
00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:46.267
Oh no. They died?

405
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:50.563
Sometimes, saving the world requires complex decisions.

406
00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:53.442
Decisions made by a true leader.

407
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:59.656
Hail, Tannen-Knight, leader of the Robo-Trees.

408
00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:03.367
They did it. What an ending.

409
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.120
They outdone the Gunn.

410
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.667
-We're back. Oh my God! -We're alive!

411
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:14.045
We were dead in the movie! Actually dead.

412
00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:17.215
Wow, Dad. Looks like us dying really affected you.

413
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.799
No, he just forgot to blink.

414
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.260
Still. I admit it. Making movies is hard.

415
00:20:21.261 --> 00:20:23.930
From now on, I'm just gonna be an impossible-to-please fan.

416
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:26.599
You said it! Let's go troll some comment sections.

417
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.893
Oh God, where did James Gunn go?

418
00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.771
Fuck James Gunn. Where's the goddamn hard drive?

419
00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:35.024
I'm telling you, Mr. Brothers, they cracked the code.

420
00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:38.069
This won't just put butts in seats and sell popcorn,

421
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.363
it will give people hope.

422
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:43.908
It could save Hollywood. It could change everything.

423
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:47.787
Nice work, Mr. Gunn. Give the man a sundae.

424
00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.539
Ooh, I love sundaes.

425
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:02.511
Why was it called a sundae?

426
00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:07.139
It's a Maximum Velocitree

427
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.558
Robotic trees against adversity

428
00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:11.477
It's not rocket science or geometry

429
00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:13.896
So sit on back and watch the movie

430
00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:16.274
Five trees against a cactus man

431
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.234
Next summer, we'll be back again

432
00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:20.152
Gotta fill our content demand

433
00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:22.446
If domestic tanks, there's always Japan

434
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:24.073
All we need is friendship and sunshine

435
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.324
Choking on a wild vine

436
00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:27.076
No one stops us growing from the ground up

437
00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:29.704
Baron Thistle and his Hench-Weeds lookin' like some bad seeds

438
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:31.122
Now Velocitrees are gonna round up

439
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.124
They have a tendency to fight tyrannic succulents

440
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.126
They have a tendency for kicking plant ass

441
00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:38.005
It's a Maximum Velocitree

442
00:21:38.672 --> 00:21:39.839
Okay, Jerry. All set.

443
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.883
But for the record, I do not condone using the Movie-lizer in this way.

444
00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:44.468
Hear that, Dad? You're good to go.

445
00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:48.180
Can't believe I'm actually inside Space Jam 7.

446
00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:50.433
Oh, hey, LeBron. Still doing this, huh?

447
00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:51.560
Let's get outta here.

448
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.189
Hey, guys. You know how I've been writing raptor porn on the side?

449
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.443
I'm ready to share it with the world.

450
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.778
Oh, well, guess I'll just leave it on this machine

451
00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:04.323
till they come back.

452
00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.909
Guys? You still there? Oh no.

453
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.746
Dear God. What is that?

454
00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.498
Stop! Let go of me!

455
00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:15.750
What are you doing? Stop!

456
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.585
Don't just stand there, Speedy Gonzales.

457
00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:18.879
Do something!

458
00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:21.840
Did you get any of that?
