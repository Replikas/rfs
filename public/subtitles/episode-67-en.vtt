1
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.520
H-Hey, Rick... uh, need me for any adventures?

2
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.780
- Huh? - Adventures? Remember those?

3
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.760
Oh, y-yeah, not right now, Morty, uh,

4
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.740
but d-definitely next week though.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.500
You been saying that a while now, buddy,

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.180
so, I think I'm gonna give you a little nudge

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.902
by cashing in a few of these bad boys.

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.196
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're still doing the punch card system?

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.210
Never stopped.

10
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.490
Bam! Read 'em and weep.

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.530
Fully punched cards, each entitling me

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.160
to an adventure of my choosing.

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.680
- I don't make the rules. - Yeah, I do, you little gremlin,

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.530
and I definitely did not stamp all these.

15
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.989
You never remember to stamp the cards.

16
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.449
- You're always drunk. - I didn't know we were still doing this!

17
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.172
T-This stinks to high heaven, Morty. I'm not accepting these.

18
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.329
I knew you were going to do this.

19
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.080
So I got receipts, bitch.

20
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.660
- I k... I kept notes. - This is gibberish.

21
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.350
"Isle of the Mortysaurs"?

22
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.639
"Takes One to Know One"?

23
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.230
I make up titles for each adventure.

24
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.140
You did the same thing for that MS readathon at your school, Morty,

25
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.689
- and you didn't read shit. - It's okay to lie

26
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.239
when you're fighting Multiple Sclerosis!

27
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.240
Or when you think you won't get caught!

28
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.560
How are you going to "catch me"?

29
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.770
Oh, you done and did it now, little man.

30
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060
That's your ass. Don't grift a grifter, Morty.

31
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.130
I got friends in cosmic places.

32
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.158
Yeah, uh-huh.

33
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.970
I need an audit.

34
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh, right, you were already watching.

35
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.100
- I'll come get you. - Wha-Wh-What is this?

36
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.320
- I am The Observer! - You're so busted.

37
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.780
Look at your face, you're so fucked.

38
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.960
I observe all!

39
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.620
They observe all, Morty.

40
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.960
- Cosmic all-seeing species. - So?

41
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.340
So, they're basically universal police body-cams,

42
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.429
but you can't turn them off before you beat a minority.

43
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.880
Or in your case, before you cook the adventure books!

44
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.760
- I don't do that! - We gonna find out!

45
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.104
Oh, I'm here for this!

46
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.900
I bet a solid 70% of these are bullshit.

47
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.600
Oh, quit your bitchin' and do the audit.

48
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.725
I-I got nothing to hide!

49
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.900
All right, Observer, gimme "Truth or Dare."

50
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.370
Christ, these names, Morty.

51
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.700
- It's shorthand! - I have observed it!

52
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.810
Now gaze upon me and so shall you...

53
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.380
Two attack patterns and a giant glowing weak spot...

54
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.480
"Legend of Zelda" tutorial-ass bullshit.

55
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.709
I thought it was kind of fun.

56
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.350
Halt, unidentified adventurers.

57
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.166
We are the guardians of this sanctuary.

58
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.330
One of us tells only truths, the other only lies.

59
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.672
You ever fucked this guy's wife?

60
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.860
Yes.

61
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.200
Well, how about that, he guessed right.

62
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.260
I forgive you!

63
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.471
- Oh, shit! - All right, next room.

64
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.806
No, I wanna watch.

65
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.970
Did you see how one of them lied?

66
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.420
Fine, I'll call that one legit.

67
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.938
I'm not here to nitpick, I'm here to find blatant fraud.

68
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.691
Okay, uh, show me "Late Night Western."

69
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.920
Morty, Morty, Morty, take me...

70
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.280
drive me... take me...

71
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.140
w-wan go western bacon.

72
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.840
M-Morty, western bacon now.

73
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.980
Ugh.

74
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.289
Ohoho, yeah.

75
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.541
- Before you say anything... - I knew it! Busted!

76
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.168
You're banned from that Carl's Jr.!

77
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.839
That doesn't make the drive-thru an adventure, Morty.

78
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.962
Invalid.

79
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.000
Sounds like it's anyone's game!

80
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.140
Well, n-no, it... it's not a bet, it's an audit.

81
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.840
Observer, show us "Maximum Overdrive with Clothes"!

82
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.060
At least this is better than cars.

83
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.380
Cars can run you over.

84
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.300
Okay, no, this is worse.

85
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.600
- Boom. Adventure, suck it. - All right, fine.

86
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.405
Uh, how 'bout "Whistlering Dixie"?

87
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.746
Whistler! Whattaya got to tag and bag these bastards?

88
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.690
Made this lil' puppy after I bagged my first neck-rophiliac.

89
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.470
Double-action triggers pumping out 1,400 kilos

90
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.260
of holy water per square inch.

91
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.140
- Um... - This ol' girl's got dry-aged,

92
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
Sicilian garlic expelling out

93
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.480
at 3,200 feet per second,

94
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.720
is swaddled by 5,200 Solar-joules

95
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.300
- of raw ultraviolet... - Yeaahhh...

96
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.020
... and she's only getting started.

97
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.320
I'm talkin' crucifix-shaped Chinese stars,

98
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.060
mirror-tipped wooden stakes,

99
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.189
and a... Wha...

100
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.760
Hello? G-Guys?

101
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.520
Morty, that was just an old man a rambling at us.

102
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.470
- People died! - So, by your logic,

103
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.989
9/11 was an adventure?

104
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.200
- Tweet it, see who agrees. - Very well!

105
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.860
Bear witness to 9/11!

106
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.200
- What? - No! Dude, don't,

107
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.849
just, y-you need to let us throw to the stuff, okay?

108
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.880
Okay, what's next?

109
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.416
What the hell is "Leg Day"?

110
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.140
Hey, look, Morty!

111
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.460
I-I'm a leg!

112
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.340
A leg, Morty!

113
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.882
I'm Leg Rick!

114
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.218
- Okay, I'll give you that last one. - What?

115
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.390
- I-I mean... I mean, I'll take it, but... - Hey, Morty, check this out.

116
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.670
That's clearly unlicensed.

117
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.720
- License this! - Wait, what are you doing?

118
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.200
Hey, Smith, you look hungry!

119
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.660
How 'bout some knuckle pie?

120
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.900
Wuh the huh?

121
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.860
Aw, geez. Rick's implants.

122
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.527
Big Doug... get the truck.

123
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.120
Whoo! I've never felt so alive!

124
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.990
Ayyy!

125
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.080
Oh!

126
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.900
Oh!

127
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.495
Man.

128
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.540
Turn! Back! Into! A boat!

129
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.951
I'm trying!

130
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.620
- I'm trying... - Oh, Big Doug.

131
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.190
Big Doug, no.

132
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.630
There's my guy!

133
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.179
C'mon, the hamsters turned on me, Morty.

134
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.200
We gotta go.

135
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.580
R.I.P., Big Doug!

136
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.676
Wasn't even in that one!

137
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.740
Who cares, i-it wasn't even on my list.

138
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.020
T-This guy just cued it up!

139
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.460
Speaking of cues,

140
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.570
what about all those times you two misunderstood each other?

141
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.740
Wait, what? Are you setting up a series of them?

142
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.020
Trust me, the key is grouping them with thematic connections.

143
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.020
Uhhhhhhh...

144
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.300
I-I just want to talk to Morty in private,

145
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.560
about something unrelated.

146
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.573
Yeah, we'll be right back.

147
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.110
Okay, this guy might have been kind of a mistake.

148
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.453
He's really, like, aggressive.

149
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.560
He's steamrolling us.

150
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.500
He thinks he's hosting a fucking clip show.

151
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.399
- And I don't like his voice. - I don't like his voice,

152
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.849
I-I don't like that he's doing jokes,

153
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.239
I don't like that he's talking down to you.

154
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.900
Thank you! Okay. Let's rethink this.

155
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.749
I still don't trust these, but I'll accept these cards

156
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.040
at 70 cents on the dollar.

157
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.340
Done. Fair.

158
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.440
How do we get rid of him?

159
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.019
Eh, I'll just pay the asshole and tell him he did a great job.

160
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.940
He thinks he's hosting a fucking clip show.

161
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.829
- And I don't like his voice. - I don't like his voice,

162
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.049
I-I don't like that he's doing jokes,

163
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.279
- I don't like him talking down to you. - Okay, well, that's...

164
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.520
th-that's on us.

165
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.065
- Should have seen that coming. - Seeing is more my thing.

166
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.529
Well, then you know he's about to pay you.

167
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.060
And "tell me I did a great job"?

168
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.613
Fine, you caught us, we secretly think you suck.

169
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.460
- Oh! - Here's twice what I owe you.

170
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.200
That's how little conversation we want to have about you leaving.

171
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.760
I have never seen two bigger assholes!

172
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.710
And I see all assholes!

173
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.520
Then you can see yours out.

174
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.710
Byyyyee.

175
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.129
Christ.

176
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.460
Shit, hot, so hot.

177
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.920
Gotta start in the middle, statistically the coolest.

178
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.390
You won't find a carb on my plate, Morty.

179
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.870
I'm all about that keto.

180
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.610
- No. - Is that... Is that a fucking...

181
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.567
- Clip? - I'm a fats man.

182
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.700
Gimme all the fats!

183
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.200
That burrito looks pretty carby!

184
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.238
This fucking guy.

185
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.200
That's your move? Diet shaming?

186
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.340
Just take the L, man!

187
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.617
Th-This is embarrassing.

188
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.287
Oh, I'll show you embarrassing!

189
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.120
Haaaaaaaa!

190
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.950
Do it, Morty! I-It's the only way to save the universe!

191
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.250
H-How? H-How is it the only way?

192
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.340
Morty... I'm dying...

193
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.506
it's up to you...

194
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.258
Aahh!

195
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.261
Rick!

196
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.469
- Aghhh! - What the hell are you doing?

197
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.200
Saving the universe! I think?

198
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.700
Right, Rick?

199
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.979
_

200
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.020
- This guy's nuts! - Screw you, Morty!

201
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.740
What the hell? You told me I was a hero!

202
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.980
- You were that night. - What the hell's going on?

203
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.890
Is that angry stone playing videoclips?

204
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.840
It's some weirdo Grandpa hired to prove I'm a bad person.

205
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.850
Turns out people that take that job aren't fun to be around.

206
00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.873
Get out of here!

207
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.875
Sidewalk's public property, bro!

208
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.419
I can observe all I want from here!

209
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.540
This isn't our problem, Dad.

210
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.680
Please make this loud thing go away.

211
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.540
Yeah, I was studying for a test.

212
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.940
No, you weren't!

213
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.510
Fucking rock asshole.

214
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.530
Now you've done it!

215
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.141
As they've shamed me, so shall I now shame you!

216
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.909
Mom? Are you drinking wine in there?

217
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.470
Um... no, I'm shitting.

218
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.890
Bitch, I know the sound of a toilet lid moving.

219
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.980
- Woof. - Two birds, one stone.

220
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.750
More embarrassing for Mom than me.

221
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.930
I wasn't lying, I was going to shit.

222
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.951
What's going on here?

223
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.745
Cosmic being playing embarrassing clips out of spite?

224
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.980
Damn, Jerry. Nailed it.

225
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.082
I was watching from the upstairs window.

226
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.917
Well, watch this, loser!

227
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.070
Morty, I'm throwing out some stuff

228
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.570
from our last couple adventures.

229
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.040
You got any use for this diamond?

230
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.200
Nope. I'm good.

231
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.432
This is gonna be fine.

232
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.939
I'm sorry! I can't stop once I start!

233
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.580
Whatever, everyone knows I'm embarrassing.

234
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.571
- I'm bulletproof. - Oh, my God, this is so sad.

235
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.782
Not as sad as you after this!

236
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.160
The so-called "Hottie Snatchers"

237
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.530
have spread to Canada and Mexico,

238
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.200
grabbing the most attractive residents

239
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.780
and taking them God knows where.

240
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.610
All Americans, even sub-sevens, are advised to stay indoors.

241
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.450
You certainly wouldn't be safe out there.

242
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.520
Not on the air, Michael.

243
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.170
BRB, bathroom.

244
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.640
I need to know!

245
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.520
It's okay!

246
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.350
It's not real, they're just doing it at random!

247
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.680
Is everything okay? I heard a...

248
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.930
You too, huh?

249
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.819
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

250
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.700
I don't deserve this. I just walked downstairs.

251
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.650
Okay, well, if Dad's just gonna stand here,

252
00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.140
should I do something?

253
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.459
Unless that somehow tees me up...

254
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.260
- Walked right into it! - This is our target,

255
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.700
Dichotomus Daniel...

256
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.660
That was my chair.

257
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.790
- It was a fart. - Birdperson always knows.

258
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.799
It's true! He's got that beak!

259
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.134
Get lost, you piece of shit!

260
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.637
Why, so you can do stuff like thiiis?

261
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.270
Ugh, Morty...

262
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.540
I'm afraid the only way out

263
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.608
is through the bottom of this massive vat of whale semen.

264
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.000
Well, that last one was just for shock value.

265
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.111
Fuck this guy!

266
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.656
Haha, if you can't take the heat,

267
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.970
get out of the watchin'!

268
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.480
You... You... You... You suck!

269
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.600
S-Showing weird shit

270
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.199
just 'cause we w-wouldn't let you treat our lives like a clip show!

271
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.759
- Yeah, get him, Morty! - Mess him up, little bro!

272
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.680
What, you gonna beat me up like the piss guy?

273
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.120
Hey! Not cool!

274
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.879
Why don't you tee up this clip of me kicking your ass!

275
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.260
Ow! Oww!

276
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.380
Aghhh, I'm all rocks now!

277
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.430
I never saw this coming...

278
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.308
Shit!

279
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.640
T-These guys can die?!

280
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.170
I-I thought they were cosmic!

281
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.069
You know what, I say we leave this thing in the street,

282
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.380
deny any involvement, and just hope this blows over.

283
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.820
Unless, of course, they play this exact clip on a screen

284
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.080
in front of a jury with some kind of built-in bias.

285
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.448
As an observer, I try to stay impartial,

286
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.909
but I am not seeing innocence.

287
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.200
It's not blowing over, Rick.

288
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.920
I'd tell you to stay positive, Morty,

289
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.706
but I do not like the looks of that jury.

290
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.620
I can't believe we got ourselves into this mess

291
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.950
over something as petty as what an adventure is.

292
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.200
Yeah, I-I guess I can admit I got a little loose with the stamps...

293
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.050
Gotcha! Can the stenographer read back that confession, please?

294
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.596
Silence! The killing of an observer is unforgivable.

295
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.309
We must now decide whether to end your existence.

296
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.320
Your Honor, if everyone here has truly seen everything,

297
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.648
then you all know my grandson and I did this whole thing with giants.

298
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.233
Did what whole thing?

299
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.901
I will address that!

300
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.260
I'm your court-appointed defender.

301
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.116
Your Honor, observe the time Rick and Morty did this with giants!

302
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.500
This is an open and shut case, Morty.

303
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.079
Y'know w-w-what do ya think is gonna happen,

304
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.850
some magical angel's gonna show up and...

305
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.960
Fee-fi-fo-fum,

306
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.870
I smell the violation of civil liberties!

307
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.920
The moments are practically identical, Your Honor.

308
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.790
I move for a mistrial on the grounds it bumps.

309
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.180
If the argument is that Rick and Morty repeat their mistakes,

310
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.130
the prosecution agrees!

311
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.759
Oh, God, y-you sound just like the guy we killed...

312
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.930
uh, a-allegedly.

313
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.840
That was my brother!

314
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.393
I didn't like his voice either!

315
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.062
Well, this isn't gonna help our case.

316
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.230
Neither will this next clip!

317
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.400
Morty, I made you a gorilla gun.

318
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.270
- Pretty cool, huh? - A gorilla gun?

319
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.695
- D-Does this do what I think it does? - Yup!

320
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.320
Where's your lunch money, punk?

321
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.448
Lunch money?

322
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.575
Are you sure you wouldn't rather have... a banana?

323
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.030
I thought it would turn him into a gorilla.

324
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.360
Why would you want a bully to be a gorilla?

325
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.100
It was a gun that kills gorillas.

326
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.180
Please go easy on him, th-this one's on me,

327
00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.380
and it won't happen again.

328
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.757
- Morty, this is a bully gun. - Whoa! Cool!

329
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.360
- Any questions about it? - Not really.

330
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.677
Yeah, should be self-explanatory. Have fun.

331
00:14:05.233 --> 00:14:06.460
Hey. Give me your backpack.

332
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.473
- You trying to bully me? - Yeah.

333
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.839
Well, how are you going to bully...

334
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.320
another bully?

335
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.000
What are you doing?

336
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.980
I feel like this one's not entirely my fault.

337
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.200
- Okay, how do you feel? - I-I'm okay.

338
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.830
I mean, maybe just stop giving me guns, or...

339
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.040
Or make them less ambiguous, way ahead of you.

340
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.200
Here. Take this.

341
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.300
This is a gun, and I want to be really specific here,

342
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.580
this is a gun that you only use to shoot bad people.

343
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.180
- Are we clear? - Okay, Rick.

344
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.690
When are you going to use that?

345
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.640
When I want to shoot a bad person.

346
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.900
Okay.

347
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.299
I had a great time tonight, Jessica.

348
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.675
Hey. Give me your money.

349
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.620
Why don't you take this instead?

350
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.720
Jeffrey Dahmer?

351
00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.040
- Hi. - Uh, what's happening?

352
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.160
I don't know, just run.

353
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.340
Let the record show this bit continued for several more guns.

354
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.990
What are we even guilty of in that one, being kind of dumb?

355
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.660
For being dumb over and over!

356
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.500
A-ha! But, Your Honor, is that not the definition of experimentation?

357
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.200
The foundation of science?

358
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.540
And are Rick and Morty therefore not only not not learning,

359
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.460
but therefore actively learning?

360
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.998
Observe this example!

361
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.759
_

362
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.000
How long before Ben Franklin comes back to life?

363
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.040
Holy shit! Yes!

364
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.440
Shit, he came back evil.

365
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.519
What do you think will happen

366
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.360
- if we bury him again? - You don't know?

367
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.040
This is my first time using Pet Sematary soil, Morty.

368
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.806
I mean... as long as we're asking questions...

369
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.730
we've been here so long my phone died.

370
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.759
It's not gonna charge your phone!

371
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.436
So you can be curious and I can't?

372
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.620
Fuck, you're right.

373
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.700
W-We're sitting on top of brand-new science here.

374
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.191
L-Let's gather some data!

375
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.360
- Put your back into it, Morty! - Y-You think it'll refill the tank?

376
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.170
Good pitch, Morty!

377
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.570
Okay, let's bury that kangaroo from the waist down.

378
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.560
Holy shit! Will only his legs come back?

379
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.580
Who knows?!

380
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.060
Hey, I'm having a great time with you tonight, Morty!

381
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.540
- W-What's that one? - Ben Franklin!

382
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.380
R-Remember we tried wrapping him in tin foil

383
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.629
- to see if it'd shield him from the evil? - Oh, yeah.

384
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.940
Ow! Fuck!

385
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.383
- I-It's hot! - Jesus Christ...

386
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.780
It cooked him like a pig at a luau.

387
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.500
- It's so moist. - Rick! That's a guy!

388
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.433
Man, what is this place doing to us?

389
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.186
Is nothing sacred to you two?

390
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.779
What are these clips? Wh-What are we even on trial for anymore?

391
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.900
What's anyone on trial for, son?

392
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.526
Being good or evil.

393
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.460
L-Look, sure, we can be irreverent,

394
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.120
but w-we're far from evil.

395
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.822
We make more friends than enemies!

396
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.908
Let's run the tape on that one!

397
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.200
Hey, Rick, can you make my churro come to life?

398
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.240
On it!

399
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Hiiiiiiii! I'm Churry!

400
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.420
Churry, do you want to have fun?

401
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.583
Let's go!

402
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.269
_

403
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.780
This has been the best time of my life, Churry.

404
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.500
Okay, thanks, Rick!

405
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.576
Y-You can turn him back into a regular churro now.

406
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.230
What? I-I can't turn him back.

407
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.599
You asked me to bring him to life.

408
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.660
Bam, done.

409
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.840
But he's a churro, he doesn't have internal organs,

410
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.010
a brain, et cetera.

411
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.301
In order to live, I had to make him functionally immortal.

412
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.088
What.

413
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.089
_

414
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.888
My... My family!

415
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.820
Goodbye, Churry. I'll miss you.

416
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.730
These are just regular churros?

417
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.820
Oh, my God, no! Mark my words, Morty!

418
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.110
I shall leave you as you left me!

419
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.730
On a barren planet!

420
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.117
Praying for death!

421
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.360
I'm starting to see why this lawyer was free.

422
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.100
Okay, well, we never intentionally hurt people.

423
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.129
Yeah, we adventure! Stuff goes wrong.

424
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.460
We don't just murder for fun.

425
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.650
Oh! Here's a clip about that topic!

426
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.440
I did it, Morty!

427
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.600
I killed the versions of us that were in "Space Jam"!

428
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.980
- Help me with the bodies! - Wow!

429
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.850
- How you'd do it, Rick? - It was easy, Morty.

430
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.887
Th-They welcomed death! They wanted out, Morty!

431
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.360
No, no, no, you don't get it, they begged me.

432
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.380
- It was a kindness! - Was that helpful?

433
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.602
It was for the prosecution!

434
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.354
Okay, I've heard enough!

435
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.800
No, you fucking haven't.

436
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.608
If we're about to die, at least let us defend ourselves.

437
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.739
- Ahh, the outrage! - Ehh, seems iffy.

438
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.960
I'll allow it.

439
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.528
But no lollygagging!

440
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.740
I only need one clip, Your Honor.

441
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.034
If it pleases the court, hold on to your tits.

442
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.940
I'm a leg, Morty! You like that?

443
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.370
Yeahhh, I know you do.

444
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.610
Oh! We already saw that one.

445
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.999
No, that's the other time I did it.

446
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.500
That was your Hail Mary?

447
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.801
- I held onto my tits for nothing! - Boooo!

448
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.094
- That was mid! - Boo!

449
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.220
I hereby find Rick and Morty guilty!

450
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.760
Time to die!

451
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.650
- What in tarnation? - Plot twist!

452
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.611
Whattaya expect? You gave me access to your tech.

453
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.849
Look, I-I'm not saying we're heroes,

454
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.789
but in the two minutes I've had access to your server,

455
00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.243
I can "observe" you're no better.

456
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.619
Here, let's see a clip.

457
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.680
Help! Please!

458
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.260
Oh, my God! Please!

459
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.650
Augh! Please!

460
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.490
Absurd!

461
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.360
If the Observer was in the clip,

462
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.620
who was watching?

463
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.635
Glad you asked!

464
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.320
Please!

465
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.380
Augh!

466
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.392
Jesus Christ.

467
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.039
You can't shame us for watching!

468
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.061
It's who we are!

469
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.480
Right, and you'd never take advantage of that.

470
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.780
Hot copies! Freshly watched!

471
00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.700
I've got "Avatar" 3 through 6!

472
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.200
Friends and Family screening, the VFX aren't done,

473
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.530
but they're still blue!

474
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.060
It's not my fault I saw those movies!

475
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.452
Yes! We observe, it's all we do!

476
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.328
Ohhoho! It's not all you do.

477
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.690
I'll give you guys $20 to fight each other.

478
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.620
Money, money!

479
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.020
As it turns out, you do plenty!

480
00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.320
You're just as bad as us!

481
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.660
We're not all bad.

482
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.842
I observe a couple of bad apples!

483
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.640
Who are you calling an apple?

484
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.513
Should we all observe what you did with Tom's wife?

485
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.683
Observe me harder! Harder!

486
00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.500
I regret nothing, Tom!

487
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.340
The only thing you could never see

488
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.100
was what a treasure Nancy was.

489
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.649
- I'll kill you! - I'd like to observe you try!

490
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.880
Geez, Rick.

491
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.740
People be fucking each other's wives, huh?

492
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.100
Marriage is a scam, Morty.

493
00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.110
Let's scram.

494
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.244
Wait! I still have more clips!

495
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.620
Morty, I appreciate what you were trying to do,

496
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.999
with the punch cards, my whole groove thing.

497
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.220
Thanks.

498
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.910
So... is this a stamp?

499
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.044
Or you gonna make me count this as my adventure?

500
00:20:56.045 --> 00:20:57.750
How about we just ignore this one.

501
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.720
Yeah. Yeah, good call.

502
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.511
80 cents on the dollar?

503
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.840
- 75. - Done.

504
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.660
Whattaya say, Rick? Fly through space,

505
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.350
come upon something, maybe I have a moral objection,

506
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.610
stuff gets messy, and you ultimately bail us out?

507
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.771
L-Let's take it for a spin.

508
00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.480
Rick and Morty! We're back, baby!

509
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.910
Check the glovebox!

510
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.609
Whoa, another gun!

511
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.460
Hey, Morty, see you at the frolf mixer tomorrow?

512
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.063
Y-Yeah, sure thing, Jimmy.

513
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.067
I knew this day would come...

514
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.404
Oh, oh, God! Aaah!

515
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.520
Nice.

516
00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.030
Free churro.

517
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.410
Whew.

518
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.454
- Aaah! - _
