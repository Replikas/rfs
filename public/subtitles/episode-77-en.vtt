Also, don't sit on that chair.

181
00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.530
The cushion is knives.

182
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.157
Somebody's got to sit on it!

183
00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.950
Gene should sit on it.

184
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.120
Bam! Nice!

185
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.290
Whoo-hoo!

186
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.708
Hey there, girls.

187
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.210
I'm guessing one of you is Beth from next door,

188
00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:44.045
and one of you is her... clone?

189
00:07:44.046 --> 00:07:46.006
But you're both little girls now?

190
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.716
Not that strange, given what I've seen.

191
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.593
What are you, a scientist?

192
00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.094
Come sit in our chair.

193
00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:54.097
Well, based on the design of your makeshift harpoon,

194
00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:56.725
seems like you girls are on a bit of a spree.

195
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.227
Feel like I'm gonna be walking into some booby traps.

196
00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:00.687
Let's have some cocoa instead.

197
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:04.232
"Let's have some cocoa." "I'm divorced."

198
00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.568
Hey! That is cruel and technically untrue.

199
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.153
But you're in an altered headspace,

200
00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.738
so I know you don't mean it.

201
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.491
Why don't you two sit tight? I'll get the Swiss Miss.

202
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.576
Let's go. Go where?

203
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.913
Go hunt him. Unless you're scaaared.

204
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.539
I'm not scared of anything.

205
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.209
Let's get in the walls.

206
00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:24.336
Morty: Wow, this is a good photo of us.

207
00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.670
Keep talking.

208
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.506
I can smell your rotting breakfast.

209
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.258
Oh, God. Your hairs are insane.

210
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.760
They're all over your body.

211
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.929
Can I touch them? Say a human phrase.

212
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.307
Say "grocery list" in that stinkbody accent.

213
00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.433
You mean my voice?

214
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:39.851
Yes! "Grocery list."

215
00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.353
I love your tooth-filled big hole

216
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.438
and the other, less-used holes on your face.

217
00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:44.981
Okay, um,

218
00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:47.943
I'm getting the feeling that you're not into me

219
00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:52.781
a-as much as you like the idea of being with any human.

220
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.658
Does it matter if I'm still turned on?

221
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.159
No, I guess it doesn't.

222
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.204
I want to get your wet muscle in my mouth.

223
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.539
You mean my tongue?

224
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.582
I don't care what it's called.

225
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:04.626
Rick, I know you're having a bad time.

226
00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.170
But I think I saw a Panera up there

227
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.838
that might change your tune.

228
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.632
A Panera?! Yeah!

229
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.218
Shut up. Is that Kevin Costner?

230
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.511
Wait, why do I know that?

231
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.304
Did Father make new models?

232
00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:17.847
I don't recognize you three.

No, I'm... Old Guy Fieri,

236

Or Brett Kavanaugh.

237
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.481
I wouldn't know. I never left this park.

238
00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:27.566
Us, too.

239
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.318
We're looking for Dogballs.

240
00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.658
He lives below.

241
00:09:39.787 --> 00:09:41.663
Dr. Dogballs. My man!

242
00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.873
Humans! Real humans!

243
00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.959
The mad genius who built Earth World!

244
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.420
Nobody loves Earth as much as me.

245
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.839
Car, Muscle Beach, property taxes.

246
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.341
But before I could complete my perfect vision,

247
00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:56.386
I was caught with incriminating files on my computer,

248
00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:58.638
and the board chained me up.

249
00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.432
I watch animal pornography.

250
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.058
It's my business.

251
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.727
Like with people and animals?

252
00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.145
No, just the animals, sicko.

253
00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.063
The original Earth World was incredible.

254
00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:08.857
I-I got strep from a candy once!

255
00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.359
Of course you feel that way. You're a human being.

256
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.571
You know what Earth theme parks are supposed to be like.

257
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.698
I'd take you to the dead zone if I could

258
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.242
and show you some of the old delights.

259
00:10:19.243 --> 00:10:21.202
But they won't let me leave my office.

260
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.748
They won't, but I will.

261
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.376
Welcome to the real Earth World!

262
00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:31.046
I guess this is closer to how I remember it.

263
00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.090
Oh! I stepped on a rusty nail!

Hot cocoa with extra marshmallows!

Hope you got room for extra marshmallows!

268
00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.393
Look at him holding marshmallows over our heads.

269

Like that's some kind of power.

270
00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:48.688
I do like marshmallows.

271
00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:50.690
He doesn't decide about our marshmallows!

272
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:52.275
You should go up there and cut him.

273
00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:53.693
You should cut him.

274
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:54.944
[ Whispering ] What should we cut?

275
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:57.114

Great. Now we have to take care of him.

280

I don't want to take care of anybody!

281

You take care of him! It was your idea!
