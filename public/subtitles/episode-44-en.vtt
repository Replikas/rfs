WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.750
Ahh, I love that new T-shirt smell.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.269
Chicks are gonna be up all up in our biz

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.269
when they see us wearing these Rick and Morty custom tees.

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.360
I bet we could sell these.

5
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.279
Hells yeah. I [BLEEP] love merch!

6
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.039
- Aah! The rain! It... It burns! - Oh, [BLEEP].

7
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.765
Quick, Morty, protect the shirts!

8
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.498
- The door! Open the door! Rick! - Is it...

9
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.700
Morty, will ya stop tryna...

10
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.989
Okay, there, it's open.

11
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.100
- Jesus. - My skin is on fire.

12
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.700
W-Why is the rain doing that?

13
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.680
My acid rain will destroy all things green and natural

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.040
or my name isn't Diesel Weasel.

15
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.661
Huh. Well, that guy's easy to please.

16
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280
Your acid rain is an acid pain...

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.220
in the butt, Diesel Weasel!

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.460
- Wow. - Yikes. Who's the chick

19
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.794
in need of a dialogue pass?

20
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.060
First order of business is to clean up this acid rain

21
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.829
- with a little wind! - Yoww!

22
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.260
Ow! Ow, my leg!

23
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.344
Wow.

24
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.380
And now an elemental punch that's too hot to handle!

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.890
Wa-kah!

26
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.975
Oh, wow.

27
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.380
Curse you, Planetina!

28
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.520
I'll get you next slime!

29
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.450
There's only one solution for Earth's pollution...

30
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.939
you!

31
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.520
- Wow. - Morty, if you say "wow"

32
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.639
one more time, I swear to [BLEEP] God...

33
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.139
Are you crazy, Rick? She's right there!

34
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.250
Yeah, get that aluminum, Morty. It's 8% of the Earth.

35
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.283
We'll need every atom.

36
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.910
Thanks! Every litter-bit helps!

37
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.580
Your problem!

38
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.980
- Excuse me? - S-Sorry. I-I-I wanted to say,

39
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.520
"N-No problem, you're welcome,"

40
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.544
a-a-and it came out "your problem."

41
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.020
I-I'm an idiot. Sorry.

42
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.420
You're not an idiot. You recycled.

43
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.760
- I-I'm Morty. - Nice to meet you, Morty.

44
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.820
I'm Planetina, and I hope you have a wonderful day.

45
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.569
Hey! The [BLEEP] we doin' here?

46
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.940
Uhh, y-y-you like soft serve?

47
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.308
There's a shop around the bend.

48
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260
Oh, I don't eat ice cream.

49
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.479
Veal is a product of the dairy industry.

50
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.490
Oh, that's not good.

51
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.020
No, it is not.

52
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.025
Oh, my God! Come on!

53
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.600
- Let's go! - I know a place that serves

54
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.840
cruelty-free doughnuts.

55
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.719
If you'd like, I could fly you and your friend there

56
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.040
easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy.

57
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.658
Okay, I-I-I'll ask him.

58
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.243
He... He said he can't come. Let's go!

59
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.530
What the [BLEEP] was that shit?

60
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.960
The Earth is in danger!

61
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.701
Pollution and waste are ruining our planet.

62
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.940
Mother Nature has enlisted the help of four young adults

63
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.414
from each major ethnicity... and when things look bad,

64
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.200
and I mean really bad... they combine the powers

65
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.760
of their elemental rings to create me!

66
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.900
Planetina, conservationist super person!

67
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.380
There's only one solution...

68
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.300
for Earth's pollution... you!

69
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.140
P-Pretty cool, huh? I-I can't believe

70
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.720
I actually hung out with Planetina.

71
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.480
How old is this woman? She looks very mature.

72
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.380
She's a sentient amalgam of natural elements,

73
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.020
so I don't believe age applies to her.

74
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.220
Great. Taylor Murphy dumps me

75
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.960
the day before his hella-big pool party

76
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
and my little brother's dating a phase four super hero.

77
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.880
Just shoot me in the [BLEEP] head until I die.

78
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.500
Hey, hey, none of that, Summerfest.

79
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.319
Look what you're doing to your sister, you piece of [BLEEP].

80
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.979
- Is it weird that she hasn't texted me yet? - Yes.

81
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.991
- No. - What if I told you

82
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.739
that your Grandpa Rick's got something up his sleeve

83
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.759
that's so Rick-diculous that it's gonna make you forget

84
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.830
all about that stupid asshole that dumped you?

85
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.957
Hey, my egg plate!

86
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.060
Morglutz, Slartivart, and Ferkus 9...

87
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.350
three planets are all ending in a delayed succession

88
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.440
of cataclysmic events.

89
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.600
A jam like this comes around only once in a lifetime.

90
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.340
Morglutz's sun is going supernova,

91
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.100
Slartivart is falling into a black hole,

92
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.740
and Ferkus 9 is getting "Deep Impact"-ed by an asteroid.

93
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.708
They're all having a major, final blow out...

94
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.360
and I'm gonna drug it up and suck it up

95
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.040
before each one goes ka-blamo,

96
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.380
and I'm taking my favorite grandkid along with me!

97
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.300
- Hells yeah. - 10 seconds on Morglutz,

98
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.349
and you'll be up to your neck

99
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.620
in I-could-give-two-[BLEEP]- about-what's-his-ass.

100
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.651
And also herpes.

101
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.379
- Um... - Oh, my God, thank you, Grandpa Rick!

102
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.529
I'm gonna go pack my rollie.

103
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.680
Um, Summer? I-I-I haven't given you my approval yet.

104
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.849
Summer, approval is yet to be given here!

105
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.539
There's a huge forest fire

106
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.780
like 200 miles from here!

107
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.900
This is amazing! Planetina's bound to be there.

108
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.240
Mom, I-I need the credit card

109
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.809
- to buy a train ticket. - Absolutely not.

110
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.039
Mom, this is the biggest wildfire of the year!

111
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.069
- You're not going! - You're not going!

112
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.599
Da [BLEEP] I'm not. Last time I checked,

113
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.319
- this wasn't Russia. - It's not Russia, Jerry.

114
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.780
My heart is broken, and I deserve to let loose,

115
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.420
and if you don't like it, you can suck my bigger [BLEEP].

116
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.139
AdiÃ³s, C-words.

117
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.720
Morty, I don't want you getting hurt.

118
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.559
- Please, think this over. - I don't want to think!

119
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.394
I want to see a girl I like.

120
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.319
If you don't want to help me, I'll find my own goddamn way

121
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.880
to the wildfire.

122
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.360
- I'll get the wine. - Thank you.

123
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.280
The Governor has implemented a mandatory evacuation.

124
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.720
Abandon all hope, people! Nothing will stop this fire.

125
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.380
Nothing! Scratch that!

126
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.916
Here's Planetina, Savioress of Earth!

127
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.120
Yeeouch! Talk about a hot foot.

128
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.378
Better put this wildfire on ice!

129
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.149
Come here, little buddy. Come on, come on, come on,

130
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.360
I gotcha.

131
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.260
Morty?! What are you doing here?

132
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.040
Oh, hey! Y-You're here, too?

133
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.960
Yeah, I heard about the wildfire back home,

134
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.619
and, you know, I stopped by to lend a hand.

135
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.379
H-Here you go, fella. All safe now.

136
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.103
Ahh, rabbits... al-always hopping...

137
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.145
Never stoppin'.

138
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.760
Y-Yeah.

139
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.480
S-So it was, uh, great hanging... hanging out the other day.

140
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.680
I-I was getting kind of a...

141
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.070
I mean I-I got kind of a p-positive vibe.

142
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.680
Oh, good. I was putting one out.

143
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.948
I-I really like you.

144
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.400
Holy [BLEEP]. I-I-I mean, uh, well, oh, all right.

145
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.245
Next step, you w-want to go out again?

146
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.332
I do! But, uh, Morty, I have kids.

147
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.668
Oh, I-I-I'll get along with them. I'm-I'm a kid.

148
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.820
No, I mean the four kids that bring me into existence

149
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.559
by combining the power of their elemental rings

150
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.424
so I can save Earth from ecological disasters.

151
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.640
Oh, them! No, I-I know about them.

152
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.670
I-I like them.

153
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.470
Oh, good. Well, here they are now.

154
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.680
Hey, buddy, you want an autograph?

155
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.820
That's 20 bucks a pop.

156
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.840
No, Eddie, he's my friend.

157
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.340
Morty, these are my kids, The Tina-Teers.

158
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.430
- Oh, hey. - Tina, girl, have you gained weight?

159
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.299
Uh, well, I had a plant-based doughnut yesterday.

160
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.980
- Just a half. - Sugar is worst thing for figure, darling.

161
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.321
You want to be ugly?

162
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.239
Heh, I-I thought they'd be younger.

163
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.480
They've been manifesting me since the mid-'90s.

164
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500
A lot has changed since then.

165
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.120
This is freaking you out, huh?

166
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.955
It is a lot to take in.

167
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.040
I understand.

168
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.786
Well, I guess I'd better go.

169
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.186
See you around.

170
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.720
Hi-de-ho, TV 58!

171
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.260
Planetina, you single-handily saved

172
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.520
a National Forest with ease.

173
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.560
I do what I can, but I can't do it alone!

174
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.779
And who's your friend over there?

175
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.460
Oh! This is Morty Smith.

176
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.340
He traveled 200 miles just to save a rabbit from the fire.

177
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.666
He's a very special guy.

178
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.926
So, are you two dating?

179
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.996
Oh, um, w... I-I-I...

180
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.188
Yes, we are.

181
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.524
- [BLEEP] love. - [BLEEP] love.

182
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.209
- All right, time to set the rules. - Lay it on me.

183
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.235
- No whining. - Done.

184
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.362
- No crying. - As if.

185
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.876
And absolutely, positively no getting attached.

186
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.580
We're here to smash max ass... quantity over quality.

187
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.750
- Deal? - Deal! I'm gonna eat so much [BLEEP],

188
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.787
you're gonna shit.

189
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.379
Check this out. This is gonna be me at the party...

190
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.520
b-b-laaaah!

191
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.880
B-b-blaaaah! Oh, is that another [BLEEP].

192
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.280
Don't mind if I... b-b-blaaaah!

193
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.020
Ho-ho! This'll be me across the room...

194
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.419
"Excuse me, miss. It appears that you have an uneaten [BLEEP].

195
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.879
Allow me... lalalalalaaah!

196
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.899
- Lalalalalaaah! - B-b-blaaaah!

197
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.637
- B-b-blaaaah! - _

198
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.440
Whoo! [BLEEP] super nova party!

199
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.309
Love is a lie! Hack the planet!

200
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.699
The world's ending, and for some reason,

201
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.540
I want to die with you more than anyone else.

202
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.560
- Wow! - Yo, Rick, don't look now,

203
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.540
but someone's giving you the big eye.

204
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.250
'Scuse me. I got to see a man about a horse

205
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.860
- I'd rather have sex with. - Aah!

206
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.951
- Hello. - I'm Rick. Hey.

207
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.920
So, the world's ending, and for some reason,

208
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.020
I want to die with you more than anyone else.

209
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.066
- Hello. - Have fun, Grandpa Rick!

210
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.860
No commitments!

211
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.337
âª I flew to you on an airplane âª

212
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.750
_

213
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.960
_

214
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.459
âª I was afraid that you gave me strength âª

215
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.510
_

216
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.720
_

217
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.435
- âª Forever, birds were soul twin loves âª - _

218
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.770
_

219
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.522
- âª Baby, come back to me âª - _

220
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.067
âª Baby, come back like it was âª

221
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.360
Surprise!

222
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.404
- What are you doing here? - Mmm!

223
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.120
I told my kids I went out to recycle batteries.

224
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.566
All kidding aside, everyone should discard

225
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.820
used batteries at proper disposal centers

226
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.440
instead of tossing them into a regular waste bin.

227
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.916
Thanks for the tip.

228
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.880
âª Flowers never last forever âª

229
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.240
âª But we can make it past forever âª

230
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.940
âª Baby, come home to me âª

231
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.636
âª Baby, you're home with me âª

232
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.530
Solus is collapsing in five zip-zops.

233
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.580
If we time it right,

234
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.750
we can [BLEEP] together as the sun explodes.

235
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.920
Sounds ah-mazing.

236
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.120
Say, I think I left my purse back at the bar.

237
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.020
Can both of you go get it for me?

238
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.340
Anything for you, Mrs. Obama.

239
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.640
Time to ghost, Grandpa Rick.

240
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.040
Righty-right. Meet me at the car.

241
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.493
One of these has to be hers. Where'd she go?

242
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.879
I guess we'll have to start without her.

243
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.900
Oh, her loss.

244
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.700
B-b-blaaaaaaaaah!

245
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.686
Whoo! Planet number two, let's do it!

246
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.740
Sorry, I took so long. I had to ditch some clingers.

247
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.820
Let's do it. Up the [BLEEP], y'all.

248
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.180
- Geez, you okay to drive? - Shiii!

249
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.220
'Course, I-I-I'm mable.

250
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.594
Buckle up.

251
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.850
Yeah!

252
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.102
Whoo!

253
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.840
- The best week of my life! - Hello.

254
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.272
- What was that? - Nothin'.

255
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.420
Who wants to see the most radadelic lady-version

256
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.860
of a super hero?

257
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.695
- Fire! - Water!

258
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.000
- Air! - And Dirt!

259
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.900
Oh, no, the convention. Morty, wake up!

260
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.989
- We overslept. - What's happening?

261
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.360
Hey, there's a little boy on her!

262
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.040
Oh, d-d-drop the curtain!

263
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.980
- There is no curtain! - Idiots, zap her away!

264
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.700
No, no, no. Wait, I-I...

265
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.840
- Whoa! - Security!

266
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.466
What did you do? B-Bring her back!

267
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.719
- No! Let me go! - Sorry, folks.

268
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.540
Planetina will be back in a moment.

269
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.960
Until then, who wants a limited edition Funko

270
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.764
for only $50?

271
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.560
This is very bad.

272
00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.120
We are about to close deal.

273
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.420
- We cannot afford controversy. - Don't you worry.

274
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.063
I know how ta deal with this Morty kid.

275
00:10:04.064 --> 00:10:06.024
_

276
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.820
Hey, a bunch of us are going over to Hibler's place

277
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.180
to shoot ourselves.

278
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.440
Y-You want to come with?

279
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.840
Sorry, but no man's tying down Sum-Sum tonight.

280
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.156
- Hit the dicks. - Your loss, honey.

281
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.966
You could have had allllllll this.

282
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.020
Hey, check it out!

283
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.239
There's old people dancing!

284
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.820
Damn, girl. Your moves is tight.

285
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.060
- Hello. - Rick!

286
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.520
What the WTF is that Morglutzian doing here?

287
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.646
Morglutzian? She's... She's not Morglutzian.

288
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.180
She's the only blue person here without three eyes!

289
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.840
Okay, fine. B-Busted. Thi-Thi-This is, uh, Daphne.

290
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.359
Daphne, this is Summer, my granddaughter.

291
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.526
Granddaughter? Hello.

292
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.109
Daphne heard about our little party crawl,

293
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.389
and I told her she could come with.

294
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.407
I-I-In the trunk.

295
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.740
What in the actual [BLEEP], Rick?

296
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.300
We said no commitments!

297
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.200
This was to be our Apocalypse Party-crawl!

298
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.497
You broke the rules!

299
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.676
Squares follow rules, Summer. Daphne's down to freak.

300
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.206
She's up for any sick, nasty thing I want to do.

301
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.254
- Hello. - Oh, yeah, baby.

302
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.880
All right, fellas, take five.

303
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.886
He ain't gonna give me any trouble.

304
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.620
Where's Planetina?

305
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.239
- Don't you worry about her. - I want to see her!

306
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.956
Planetina's got a lot of responsibilities.

307
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.896
People depend on her. And you, my friend,

308
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.100
are a distraction we can't afford right now.

309
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.690
She's just a product to you, isn't she?

310
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.200
Something to make money off of.

311
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.800
W-Well, Planetina's more than that.

312
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.862
She's a brilliant, living thing, and I love her.

313
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.948
Oh, you love her? Well, guess what.

314
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.242
We own her.

315
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.636
But not for long, of course.

316
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.995
We're gonna sell her to some Arab overseas.

317
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.420
Fire.

318
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.832
As for you, maybe she won't love you so much

319
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.793
if you ain't so pretty no more.

320
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.419
- Stop! Yah! - Ow!

321
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.780
Y-You want to [BLEEP] with me? Do you?

322
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.340
Stupid [BLEEP] shit hole!

323
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.240
Aaaaaah!

324
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.329
Boss, what's happening? Let us in!

325
00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.513
Aah!

326
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.181
Fire!

327
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.500
Fire!

328
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.340
Can we conclude our business?

329
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.860
I'm eager to celebrate my purchase of Planetina over dinner,

330
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.440
and these infant seals aren't getting any younger.

331
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.176
Momentarily, comrade.

332
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.446
Soon, our partner will return.

333
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.574
Ugh! What is taking Eddie so long?

334
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.116
His phone keep going to voicemail.

335
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.320
âª Start leaving a message âª

336
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.360
âª I can't make it to the phone âª

337
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.326
Just kidding. It's Eddie. Go [BLEEP] yourself.

338
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.002
Which one of you ordered a pizza?

339
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.837
No one order pizza. What is this?

340
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.716
Well, I got a cheesy Italian, extra crispy just for you.

341
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.866
I know those cheek bones like they're me own!

342
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.460
- It's Eddie! - [BLEEP] Mother!

343
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.640
- Kill him! - Stone!

344
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.670
- Stone! - Fire!

345
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.101
Aah!

346
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.480
Airs!

347
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.180
Cold Water! Cold Water!

348
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.980
Dirt!

349
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.070
Fire!

350
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.238
Wa...

351
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.324
Airs.

352
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.520
Now we can be together, Planetina.

353
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.330
I am an individual character.

354
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.590
- I represent no group. - Fire!

355
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.666
- Aaah! - Water! Dirt! Airs!

356
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.050
Aah!

357
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.200
Not good!

358
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.180
Blib...

359
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.420
Naga...

360
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.520
Threve...

361
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.760
Verillex... Gam!

362
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.760
Happy Apocalypse!

363
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.586
- Oh, my gaaah! - This is awful!

364
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.750
Why were we cheering?!

365
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.126
Hello. Got any agua around here?

366
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.440
Mama's got to hydrate.

367
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.660
Glove box.

368
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.920
Oh, yeah.

369
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.034
Rick is the coolest guy ever.

370
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.452
We're total soul mates.

371
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.320
He's gonna show me the wonders of the universe.

372
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.940
Ha! Once we get to the next planet,

373
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.400
Grandpa Rick is gonna ditch you, like, so fast.

374
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.294
- Oh, is that so? - Uh-huh,

375
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.460
nobody is tying that guy down... ever.

376
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.924
The only chick seeing the universe with Rick is me.

377
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.968
Not if I keep Rick's mouth full of these.

378
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.554
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

379
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.890
Oh, yeah. That's right, girlfriend.

380
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.886
This is what you're up against.

381
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.896
Wars were fought over these.

382
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:14.280
They've ruined kings, inspired presidents.

383
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.067
A hundred songs and nine national anthems

384
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.966
have been written about them.

385
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.280
Best set of elbow-titties on Morglutz.

386
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.760
And now, thanks to Rick, the best in the galaxy.

387
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.040
You want me to put them away?

388
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.320
- Please. - Sure.

389
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.040
But only because you're Rick's granddaughter.

390
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.360
Daph? Daphne?

391
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.580
Where are ya, baby? Papa needs some more elbow grease.

392
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.480
Comin'! Ya might want to keep your eyes on the road.

393
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.780
It's about to get sloppy.

394
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.586
- Hello! - Hello.

395
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.970
Ugh!

396
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.150
Then I put my sunglasses on and walked out like nothing happened.

397
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.851
I'm finally free. All because of Morty.

398
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.500
What a romantic story

399
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.940
about our son killing a room full of people.

400
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.481
Your turn.

401
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.700
Uh, seven.

402
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.985
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

403
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.470
Oyyy, don't punch my lunch!

404
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.680
A-ha! Eat it!

405
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.940
I'm out of food cards.

406
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.146
How 'bout I loan you two quiche at 10%?

407
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.820
That's so generous.

408
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.454
My turn!

409
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.456
Double sixes, baby!

410
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.640
- One, two, three... - So, what's next for Planetina?

411
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.930
Well, now that I'm not distracted by book signings

412
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:17.961
and publicity stunts,

413
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.540
Morty and I can concentrate on more important things.

414
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.760
- Like school. - Like moving in.

415
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.500
Planetina doesn't have a place to stay now,

416
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.779
so I said she could live with us.

417
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.095
Holy shit. Morty, no.

418
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.399
- I'm so full! - What do you mean, no?

419
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.020
- Whoo! - Don't punch my lunch.

420
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.600
I wouldn't be a burden, Mrs. Smith.

421
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.840
I only want to spend as much time as possible with your son.

422
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.046
My son is 14, miss.

423
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.815
I'm sorry, Morty. You're way too young.

424
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.260
But y-y-y-you were a teenager when Dad got you pregnant.

425
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.540
I was 17! That's at least 26 in boy years.

426
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.380
I'm sure Planetina is very nice, but when you're a teenager,

427
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.742
love is fleeting, at best.

428
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.180
You underestimate Morty.

429
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.960
He is a very mature young man.

430
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.788
See, Mom? I told you!

431
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.950
This is not happening. End of discussion.

432
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.336
Planetina, I think you should leave, please.

433
00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.170
- Okay, Mrs. Smith. - Oh, no!

434
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.200
Mom, I hate you!

435
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.779
- You suck! - Hey, now, it's only a game.

436
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.799
- Shut up! - Okay.

437
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.560
My whole life, I've never fit in anywhere.

438
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.679
Everything I have to say is always met with an eye roll

439
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.840
as if the act of hearing what I have to say is some exhausting chore.

440
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.560
Nobody in this family thinks I can say or do anything right!

441
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.719
I've been all over the universe, met hundreds of people,

442
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.859
and Planetina's the only one I've ever met

443
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.480
that makes me feel like I belong,

444
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.079
and you just kicked her out of our house!

445
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.820
- Morty, please... - I will never forgive you for this!

446
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.366
âª Get the sword and throw it far âª

447
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.090
âª Let it shine under the morning star âª

448
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.800
Morty! Morty, come back!

449
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.712
âª Who are you? âª âª Who am I to you? âª

450
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.968
âª I am the antichrist to you âª

451
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.550
âª Fallen from the sky with grace âª

452
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.100
âª Into your arms race âª

453
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.981
_

454
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.151
_

455
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.310
Get out! All of you, get out of there!

456
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.740
- You're killing the planet! - Your people didn't get the votes.

457
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.247
Leave, or I'll have you arrested.

458
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.040
It's you people who should be arrested.

459
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.086
Gutting the land, poisoning the air your children breathe?!

460
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.740
- Can't you see what you're doing?! - Easy for you to say!

461
00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:25.956
You can live how you want!

462
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.940
We need the jobs. Let's go, boys.

463
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.801
She can't stop us.

464
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.340
- W-We'll get them next time. - There's no time left!

465
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.629
Can't you hear the Earth screaming?

466
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.080
- You filthy murderers! - Planetina, stop it!

467
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.159
There's only one solution for Earth's pollution!

468
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.982
Oh, my God, no.

469
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.278
âª Who am I to you? âª

470
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.320
âª I am the antichrist to you âª

471
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.491
No!

472
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.160
_

473
00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.700
I can't believe I'm banging my co-workers. And I'm the boss!

474
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.526
This gay sex with my Dad is terrific!

475
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.877
What was I thinking?

476
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.480
It'll all be over soon!

477
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.750
Last chance to pee on me! Anyone?!

478
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.430
Okay, Grandpa, the meteor's almost here.

479
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.843
- We can go now. - Ah, nah, we still got time.

480
00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.266
Well, then stop being in love and start having fun.

481
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.936
Ah, love's pretty fun, Summer. Just give it a chance.

482
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.200
It's not even real love!

483
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.660
Daphne's just with you so she can keep surviving!

484
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.860
Ah, the young... so naive.

485
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.880
Eww, gross.

486
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.586
Congratulations, Ferkisians!

487
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.760
Your apocalypse is aborted.

488
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.360
And, Grandpa, you and I can go home.

489
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.660
Daphne, you may come with.

490
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.820
If you want to and don't have to.

491
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.219
I don't know what you're getting at, Summer.

492
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.013
Obviously, Daphne wants to...

493
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.046
Aw, you cold bitch. Hello?

494
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.185
Goodbye.

495
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.600
Hey, she's the one that saved the world!

496
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.300
Now we got to go to work tomorrow!

497
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.775
You [BLEEP].

498
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.230
Sorry I messed things up with Daphne.

499
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.640
Just shut up. I get it.

500
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.740
- Really? You're not mad? - I'm furious.

501
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.070
But I have to admit, it was pretty Rick of you

502
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.280
to avert an apocalypse in a tantrum of cynicism

503
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.936
just to destroy one dumb relationship.

504
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.860
Still, sorry.

505
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.520
Eh, I would've done the same for you.

506
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.440
Promise?

507
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.460
- Love you, Grandpa Rick. - Don't make it weird.

508
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.266
_

509
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.470
_

510
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.068
Please go. I-I-I can't see you anymore.

511
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.020
Don't you even want to try to make it work?

512
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.990
- We were so close. - You murdered 300 people.

513
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.324
And you murdered my kids.

514
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.706
They were gonna sell you away forever.

515
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.360
Eddie was trying to kill me!

516
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.360
Th-Those miners were innocent.

517
00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.100
Those innocent miners voted men into power

518
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.340
to protect their precious jobs

519
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.719
so they can buy more plastic garbage

520
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.269
and eat the corpses of tortured animals.

521
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.140
The system is broken, Morty.

522
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.480
This is the only way I can save Earth,

523
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.300
the only way I can save you.

524
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.396
If that's the only way, I-I don't want to be saved.

525
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.760
- Please, go. - But... I love you.

526
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.560
I-I-I can't... I-I can't love you.

527
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.940
I-I just can't.

528
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.380
- Please understand. - No.

529
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.654
I'll go, but don't you dare ask me to understand.

530
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.032
Planetina, I-I'm so sorry.

531
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.659
[BLEEP] you.

532
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.460
Morty? Are you all right?

533
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.133
She's gone, Mom! She's gone!

534
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.366
I loved her so much!

535
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.106
I know you did, honey.

536
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.780
Shh, Mommy's here.

537
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:11.100
âª Let it shine under the morning star âª

538
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.152
âª Who are you? âª âª Who am I to you? âª

539
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.530
âª I am the antichrist to you âª

540
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:29.160
âª Fallen from the sky with grace âª

541
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.672
âª Into your arms âª

542
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.179
_

543
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.520
- Good morning. - 'Morning.

544
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.150
- Slow day, huh? - Yep.

545
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.440
Probably because everybody thought

546
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.080
the world wouldn't be, you know, like, here today.

547
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.780
- Mm-hmm. - Mom in back?

548
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.520
Mom's not talking to us.

549
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.160
Because we had sex?

550
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.420
Yes. Uh, yeah.

551
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.036
That makes sense.

552
00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.086
Happy birthday, by the way.
