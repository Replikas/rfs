1
00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:42.541
Calm down, Morty,

2
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.043
I'm almost done collecting Citadel wreckage.

3
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.753
I am calm.

4
00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.963
Your fidget spinning has a passive aggressiveness to it.

5
00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.715
I can be calm and bored.

6
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.800
Y-You're a million years late on that thing anyways.

7
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.635
Didn't the Egyptians invent those?

8
00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.138
Fashion's cyclical, babe. I'm retro.

9
00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.723
Ah! Ah, fuck!

10
00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.643
Shit! H-Hang on, we got to find a place to land.

11
00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.564
Whoa, there's people living here?

12
00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.690
Are they refugees?

13
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.400
Clones. Bio-trash.

14
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.987
I-I thought everyone got sucked back to their reality of origin.

15
00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:14.823
That happened, right? Exactly.

16
00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:16.492
The Citadel was basically a factory farm for spare bodies.

17
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.577
That portal reset sucked 'em all back.

18
00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.661
Oh.

19
00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.205
W-We don't want to stop here.

20
00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.040
This is the, uh, Morty part of town,

21
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.208
if you know what I'm saying.

22
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.086
Let's touch down over there.

23
00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.839
Alright, Morty, grab the sealant.

24
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.509
I'll make this quick.

25
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.469
Damn, this is nice corn.

26
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.637
Thank you.

27
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.180
Whoa! Alright.

28
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.807
Uh, take it easy, old-timer.

29
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.475
I've heard about loners like this, Morty.

30
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.393
What are you doing on my land?

31
00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:45.437
Trying to leave it as quickly as possible.

32
00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.397
Leave faster. Jesus.

33
00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:49.567
I was fixing it when you cocked the gun.

34
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:54.363
See? Done.

35
00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:56.115
Fuckin' hillbilly. What's that guy's deal?

36
00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.452
Morty, I can't imagine anything worse than having to know.

37
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:29.641
âª My whole Saturday and Sunday, too âª

38
00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:39.868
âª I was thinking about ways not to lose âª

39
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.916
âª I lay down my weapons is what I've done âª

40
00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:52.754
âª Too late to hide, feet too soft to run âª

41
00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:56.759
âª But people say I'm the luckiest man âª

42
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.518
We're closed.

43
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.853
G-g-get the fuck out of here.

44
00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.980
Sorry he says that every time you come in.

45
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.482
Mm-hmm.

46
00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:15.861
Widgets, gidgets, fertilizer.

47
00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.779
Hey, hey, Doc,

48
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.781
did we, uh, salvage any more of those processors?

49
00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.366
We... we did.

50
00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.619
But they're on a pretty high shelf.

51
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.956
Which I... uh, will reach.

52
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.627
Come on.

53
00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:34.379
Mortys, huh?

54
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.756
You're the worst.

55
00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.049
Aaah!

56
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.175
Oh.

57
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.138
Riiiiiicks!

58
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.139
Get over here! Aah!

59
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.224
Got one!

60
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.975
It's the jackpot, boys!

61
00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.977
Time to round up some stock!

62
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.104
Gotcha!

63
00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:53.357
I got you. That's right!

64
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.319
Aaah!

65
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.656
Boss, look what we got.

66
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.743
Are... are you one of us? Did we have an overalls guy?

67
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.995
Just tryin' to leave with my stuff.

68
00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.498
Wait, you live around here?

69
00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.792
We don't need to get acquainted. Aah!

70
00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.086
Got that right, motherfucker!

71
00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.674
Yeah! We got no code!

72
00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:21.302
Yeah!

73
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.887
Burn it all down, boys!

74
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.160
You crack that gene-lock yet?

75
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:48.203
Boss is getting antsy.

76
00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:49.871
This is the one.

77
00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.713
Aah, no! Oh, God! Aaah!

78
00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:00.633
Aw, fiddlesticks!

79
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.220
What a haul.

80
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.805
The ship smells like Morty farts now.

81
00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.559
Where's my money? Oddjob Rick, take him upstairs.

82
00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.320
You like football?

83
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.654
What?

84
00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.906
Just making small talk.

85
00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.909
Long elevator.

86
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.303
Well nawh.

87
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:50.932
My associates here tell me you rustled up quite the score.

88
00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:54.604
Oddjob? Your uh, normal job, please.

89
00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.816
I can monologue while we wait.

90
00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:01.902
You ever wonder why I'm an overweight

91
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.779
Southern railroad baron?

92
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.575
See, I was cloned to be the mascot of a Citadel gumbo chain.

93
00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:11.078
Get yo mouth round it!

94
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.456
But Big Rick's Gumbo Hutch is trash now.

95
00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.167
Whole Citadel is trash now.

96
00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:20.962
And there ain't no pecking order amongst the trash.

97
00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:22.506
What a utopia.

98
00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.132
It will be, once I have

99
00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.093
the requisite Mowty's.

100
00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.388
We can all be kings here, mistuh traffickuh.

101
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.098
Good luck with that.

102
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.976
Don't go spending it all in one place nawh!

103
00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:38.940
Filthy degenerate. No accent at awl.

104
00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.539
Oh, fuck.

105
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.478
Fuck!

106
00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:22.442
Fuck!

107
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.820
Fuck!

108
00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:58.685
Ow!

109
00:07:58.686 --> 00:07:59.561
Shh!

110
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.687
What the fuck?!

111
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:02.063
I-I-It was his idea!

112
00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:03.899
Don't hurt us! I'm not a real doctor!

113
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.567
What are you doing here? Get the fuck out of my car!

114
00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:06.985
We're coming with you to rescue our friends.

115
00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.112
I'm not going to rescue your friends.

116
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:11.573
I'm going to kill those guys who stole my shit.

117
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.326
Yeah, exactly, it's the same guys.

118
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.994
It is the same guys.

119
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.955
Flush us into space or keep driving.

120
00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:20.248
Fuckin' Mortys.

121
00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.666
Hey man, you're the one

122
00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.084
who built this truck with a back seat.

123
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:25.087
If you die, you die.

124
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.255
Ha ha. Wow.

125
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:31.301
B-B-Back on an adventure w-w-with... with... with a Rick.

126
00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.845
Close your eyes, and it's like nothing changed.

127
00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:37.015
Some change is good. We had our own town, man.

128
00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.558
We were free.

129
00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.144
Hey, ya know, my... my Rick wasn't so bad.

130
00:08:41.145 --> 00:08:42.521
Used to take me and Summer to the park.

131
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.897
No, he didn't.

132
00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.565
I have the same memory. It's fabricated.

133
00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:48.068
"Taking me and Summer to the park."

134
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.114
A new Citadel?

135
00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:56.117
You Ricks don't have many original ideas, do you?

136
00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:58.078
And you're the arbiter of taste?

137
00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.162
Cool haircut.

138
00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:00.413
Stay out of my way.

139
00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.208
Stay out of mine.

140
00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:08.922
Ooh-whee! Almost enough for a jump!

141
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.716
I'm gonna head to a reality where no one has facial hair.

142
00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.635
In the land of the blind...

143
00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.053
When I get my hop, I'm off to a dimension

144
00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:16.805
where racism is cool. Idiots.

145
00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.473
You got to have bigger plans than one jump.

146
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.517
Oh, yeah? And what's your big plan?

147
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.310
You mean after I teabag your mom?

148
00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.817
Don't even have a mom.

149
00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.910
Come on, gimme a six!

150
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.332
Damnit! That's not six!

151
00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:51.715
Where's your boss?

152
00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.174
Up your butt and around the corner.

153
00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.551
That's where this barrel is going

154
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:55.969
if you don't start talking.

155
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.513
Up your butt? Or my butt?

156
00:09:58.514 --> 00:09:59.681
Gimme back my friends!

157
00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.391
Jesus, man!

158
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.603
Whoa, whoa!

159
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.604
Where are they?!

160
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.355
They're with his stuff!

161
00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:10.609
A-at the center of this new Citadel. Help!

162
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.112
Morty-whipped son of a bitch!

163
00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.040
Aaah!

164
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.958
Get off me, you little shit!

165
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.211
Doc!

166
00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:34.549
All we did was shoot you, man!

167
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.844
Y-You can't take that personally!

168
00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.555
If we bite it here,

169
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:42.057
y-you were always a good customer.

170
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.060
Yeah. You always... had exact change.

171
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.229
Ugh. Ready?

172
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.820
Shit!

173
00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.409
T-They got me, Arcade Morty.

174
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.577
I'm... I'm dyin'.

175
00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:05.080
It's gonna be okay.

176
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.457
I-I know a doctor.

177
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:10.336
Oh, ha.

178
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.130
Hope I bleed out before I have to burn to death.

179
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.091
No medical degree, but I've read enough

180
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.761
to know one's an okay death and one is terrible.

181
00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.598
Flames aren't getting any closer.

182
00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:27.519
Looks like it'll definitely be the bleeding out one.

183
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.978
Phew.

184
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:30.480
Ah!

185
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:31.940
Bye, pal.

186
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.235
Off to the big Med School in the sky.

187
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.238
Hey! Hey!

188
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:39.406
Ow!

189
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.574
Sorry, they make me do this to bully me.

190
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:43.118
Hoof shaming.

191
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.869
To clarify, I'm sorry about the needle prick.

192
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.788
Overall, I agree with what they're doing here.

193
00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:51.292
A-Arcade Morty?

194
00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:52.293
Shhh.

195
00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:01.720
Rich-ard San-chez. When my associates here told me

196
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.639
that strange little Mowty Town had themselves a Pet Rick

197
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.641
with a farm full of cloning equipment,

198
00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:08.226
my interest was piqued.

199
00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.769
Cloning equipment?

200
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.771
You see what we have here, gentalmyan,

201
00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:14.941
is a prince, in the guise of a pawpuh.

202
00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:18.987
Why, not only is this little henley boy not a clone,

203
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.905
he's also the Citadel's former

204
00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:23.575
Head of Mowty Replication.

205
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.618
A Morty cloning scientist?

206
00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:27.996
The best Mawty cloning scientist.

207
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.331
And from the looks of these boys,

208
00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:31.624
he's still got it.

209
00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.668
Rishard, Rishard.

210
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:36.004
And I thought I loved my job.

211
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.714
This... this is such a head fuck!

212
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:39.674
Break out the bubbly, boys!

213
00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:42.594
My Citadel is a go.

214
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.137
Get yo mouth round it.

215
00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:45.597
That place had good curly fries.

216
00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.099
Oh, ya been there?

217
00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:51.644
So you're not even a clone?

218
00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:53.480
What the fuck are you doing with your life?

219
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.190
I don't belong anywhere else, kid.

220
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.484
You don't want to be an evil Citadel guy,

221
00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.028
so instead, you live next to a bunch of cloned Mortys

222
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:01.654
on an asteroid?

223
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:03.406
Wow, you're so different.

224
00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:04.657
I never said I was a good guy!

225
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:06.284
I-I hate you!

226
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:10.830
Aw, now, that ain't no way to talk to your paw.

227
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:12.540
This is.

228
00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:15.043
Non-clone piece of sheeyat.

229
00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.587
Now, we don't need to be so unpleasant with each other.

230
00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:21.633
I'd love to offer you your old job back.

231
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.260
I'll take it. Hit the switch.

232
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.098
Don't do it! Shut up.

233
00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:31.601
Kid's right. I'm no better than any of you.

234
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.686
I'm just self-loathing about it.

235
00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:39.776
See there? I told you he was good beef!

236
00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:43.197
Alright now, think that's large enough.

237
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:51.329
Morty! Get us out of here!

238
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.455
I'm coming!

239
00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.214
Mortys, with me!

240
00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.387
Kill that abominascion!

241
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.227
So, deep down, you super love Mortys?

242
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.895
Not really.

243
00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:17.689
I'm just really good at making you.

244
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.941
I mean, look how you turned out.

245
00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.403
Don't give yourself credit!

246
00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.491
Wait, Rick. What are you doing?

247
00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:29.951
Not giving myself credit.

248
00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:32.078
Go make some memories that aren't fabricated.

249
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.580
Rick!

250
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.165
Hyah!

251
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.754
âª Ooh, these âª

252
00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:44.675
âª Little earthquakes âª

253
00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:53.100
âª Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces âª

254
00:14:54.268 --> 00:15:02.268
âª Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces âª

255
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.115
âª I can't reach you âª

256
00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:15.456
âª I can't reach you âª

257
00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:20.544
Aaah!

258
00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:24.256
âª I can't reach you âª Oh, come on naw!

259
00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:33.974
âª I can't reach you, can't reach you âª

260
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:42.106
Well, now that's a very

261
00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:45.985
expensive elevator ride you just took.

262
00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:48.279
My plans were always bigger than one jump.

263
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.281
No need for that.

264
00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:51.866
Drop the accent.

265
00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:53.618
Whatever you say, man.

266
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.578
That's your real voice?

267
00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:56.663
Ah! Shit!

268
00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.581
A desk gun?!

269
00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:01.752
An eskr-twar weapyion.

270
00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:07.715
âª Give me life, give me pain âª

271
00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:11.636
âª Give me myself again âª

272
00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:15.348
âª Give me life, give me pain âª

273
00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:20.979
âª Give me my, give me myself again âª

274
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.481
Aah!

275
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.526
Aaaah!

276
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:49.882
Aaah!

277
00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:06.232
You certainly are a burr in my saddle.

278
00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:09.152
You're a joke. I'm whatever I want to be.

279
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.571
That's the freedom of life as a clone.

280
00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:15.825
You wouldn't know. Someone made you with sex,

281
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:19.328
all those sweaty parts and nipply bits.

282
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.788
You disgust me.

283
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:26.085
It's over, man. Your dream's about to be gumbo.

284
00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:29.380
Get yo mouth round it.

285
00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.967
You... know me?

286
00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.260
F-f-father?

287
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:35.553
Oh. Oh, no, no.

288
00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.472
You're under the delusion of something called

289
00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.432
the auteur myth.

290
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:42.643
Truth is, any big project is made in collaboration,

291
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:44.437
lots of delegating.

292
00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:47.231
I sort of... gave notes.

293
00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.275
I don't want to hear this!

294
00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:52.487
Good news. You don't have to.

295
00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.697
Au revoir, son.

296
00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:57.409
You wretch!

297
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:14.510
Maybe he survived it?

298
00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:18.471
What do we do now? Go home?

299
00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:21.891
We decide where home is. For each of us.

300
00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:25.561
That old Homesteader wanted us to make memories for ourselves.

301
00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:29.816
No Morty towns, or Citadels, or huddling together.

302
00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:32.235
It's time to grow up.

303
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.597
Deal me in.

304
00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:45.308
Hey, uh, is your... is your Rick around?

305
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.560
I-I think my Morty dropped his fidget spinner down here.

306
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:49.604
I'm telling you, I checked everywhere else.

307
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.356
Morty, I swear to God if I check between the seats of our car...

308
00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:54.610
I checked between the seats!

309
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:57.904
Oh, shit, Morty. Check it out.

310
00:19:57.905 --> 00:19:59.238
I think this little dude killed his Rick.

311
00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:00.865
You really think so?

312
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.241
Yeah, look, there's a grave.

313
00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:04.076
He buried him out front as a warning.

314
00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:05.786
Damn. Ice cold.

315
00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:07.997
Is that a second, smaller grave?

316
00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.415
Burnt down his house, too.

317
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.083
Starting to think we should've stuck around.

318
00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:12.543
Jesus Christ. I-I didn't kill...

319
00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.753
Found it!

320
00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:15.421
I told you I checked between the seats!

321
00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:17.173
When you're right, you're right, Morty!

322
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.758
Told you, I admit that kind of stuff now.

323
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:21.052
And I can admit you're right about that, Rick!

324
00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.763
You're really changing!

325
00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:27.808
Assholes.

326
00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:19.653
Did you get any of that?
