1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.205
- So, dad, guess what tomorrow is. - Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.

2
00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:07.306
No.

3
00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:09.042
- Well, it... might be. - It is.

4
00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:13.912
Fine. But also, tomorrow is your one-year anniversary back in our lives.

5
00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:16.114
I'm gonna make you flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

6
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.830
Oh, t-t-there's no need to do that, Beth.

7
00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:19.477
Regular pancakes are fine.

8
00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:25.524
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.826
Oh, what is happening?!

10
00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:03.897
- Happy anniversary, dad. - Oh, I get it.

11
00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.398
Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.

12
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.597
I-I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.

13
00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.214
You should be making us a whole restaurant.

14
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:15.040
Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around.

15
00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:16.975
I just wish I got to see more of you.

16
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:21.447
Rick Sanchez of earth dimension C-137,

17
00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:22.981
you are under arrest for crimes against

18
00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.445
alternate Ricks by the authority

19
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.152
of the trans-dimensional council of Ricks.

20
00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.186
- Hey! What the heck?! - Neutralize the Jerry.

21
00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.122
Wait! No! I'll --

22
00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:30.856
Dad!

23
00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.357
- Dad! - Rick!

24
00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.492
Everybody, relax.

25
00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.828
If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes,

26
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.262
they just want to haul me to their stupid

27
00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.498
clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions.

28
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.499
Let's get it over with.

29
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:41.467
Bring his Morty.

30
00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.936
- Oh, man. - Leave my Morty out of this.

31
00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:46.371
You lost the right to have a say in these things when you

32
00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:47.940
refused to j-- join the council.

33
00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:49.341
W-w-w-what about Jerry?

34
00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:52.278
Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

35
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.680
...Give you anything!

36
00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.482
I have a rare antique-coin collection!

37
00:01:56.484 --> 00:01:57.950
Just don't hurt me!

38
00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:03.089
Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting.

39
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.090
They have little R2-D2s instead of George Washington.

40
00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:08.560
- Our son's been abducted! - You hate me for buying those coins!

41
00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:14.867
- Geez, Rick, w-what is this place? - The citadel of Ricks.

42
00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.936
It's the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.

43
00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.304
Council of Ricks?

44
00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.206
As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies

45
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.376
in the universe that consider my genius a threat --

46
00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:26.177
galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators,

47
00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.012
most of the entire intergalactic government.

48
00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.882
Wherever you find people with heads up their asses,

49
00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:31.350
someone wants a piece of your grandpa,

50
00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:34.052
and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had

51
00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:36.889
the same problem, so a few thousand versions of me had the

52
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:39.758
ingenious idea of banding together

53
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.860
like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those

54
00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:44.295
people who answer questions on yahoo! Answers.

55
00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.631
Hey! What do you know? It's a cowboy version of me.

56
00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.100
Geez, you're easy to impress.

57
00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:50.836
Yeah, most timelines have a Rick, and most Ricks have a Morty.

58
00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.372
This place is a real who's who of who's you and me.

59
00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:57.576
Turn your boring, old Morty into a-- hot fashion statement

60
00:02:57.578 --> 00:02:59.077
with some Morty dazzlers.

61
00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.679
Hey, check this out.

62
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:01.680
Show me the Morty.

63
00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:02.447
Dumb.

64
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.416
Excuse me, sir, is your Morty insured?

65
00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:06.785
You know, every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured --

66
00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:07.719
Back off!

67
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.087
Not my cup of tea, this place.

68
00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.590
I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick.

69
00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:15.505
Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick.

70
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.764
Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig.

71
00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.732
- [beep] me, pal. - [beep] you?

72
00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.135
No, no, no, no, no. [beep] me.

73
00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:37.111
Bring up the holograms.

74
00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:42.254
27 Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines--

75
00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:45.457
an unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic.

76
00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.426
What say you, earth Rick C-137?

77
00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.728
You think I did this?

78
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.631
Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?

79
00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:56.397
You have a history of non-cooperation with the council.

80
00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.800
Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick.

81
00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:00.806
W-w-w-w-w-why isn't he here in handcuffs?

82
00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:03.375
Because he's dead, too!

83
00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:05.811
Who else would you have us question?

84
00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:06.979
You fit the profile.

85
00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:09.615
Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve,

86
00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:12.317
you're the malcontent, the rogue.

87
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.218
I'm the Rick,

88
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.554
and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance.

89
00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.056
You wanted to be safe from the government,

90
00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.758
so you became a stupid government.

91
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.793
That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.

92
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.796
Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags.

93
00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:25.964
Now, if you'll excuse me,

94
00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:28.000
I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them.

95
00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.002
They're about to hit that critical point of syrup

96
00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:32.671
absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste,

97
00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:33.872
and I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it,

98
00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:37.175
but I think we all like Fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top,

99
00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:41.179
and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence!

100
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:43.949
So, as they say in Canada, peace oot!

101
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.151
Evidence! Good idea.

102
00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:47.919
Scan his portal gun!

103
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.187
Oh, come on.

104
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.456
Don't look at another man's portal-gun history.

105
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.692
We -- we all go to weird places.

106
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:57.195
Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact

107
00:04:57.197 --> 00:05:00.899
timelines and locations in which the murders occurred.

108
00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:03.035
What?! That's Rick-diculous!

109
00:05:03.037 --> 00:05:04.569
I'm obviously being set up.

110
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.039
Earth Rick C-137, the council

111
00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:11.043
of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom,

112
00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:14.012
which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds,

113
00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:15.647
rendering your fantasies pointless while

114
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.884
everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp.

115
00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.520
Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls.

116
00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.389
I've heard enough.

117
00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.459
Run, Morty!

118
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:28.760
Unh-unh. Not you.

119
00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:32.664
Aaaah!

120
00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:35.489
No!

121
00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:55.921
Oh! Oh!

122
00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:02.660
Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please.

123
00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:04.529
White people. No, no, no, no. Black people.

124
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.131
And hispanic on half.

125
00:06:17.635 --> 00:06:21.346
Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair, please.

126
00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:23.315
High chair. No, no, no, no. Recliner.

127
00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:25.283
And wheelchair on half.

128
00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:39.431
They could have gone into any one of these.

129
00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.299
- Son of a... - Oh, geez.

130
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.968
- Oh, man! - We lost 'em.

131
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.104
Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please.

132
00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.773
Cellphone. No, no, no, no. Rotary.

133
00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:49.675
And pay phone on half.

134
00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.778
That'll keep 'em busy for a while.

135
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.016
Those guys were wrong, right?

136
00:06:58.018 --> 00:06:59.917
Y-y-y-you-- you wouldn't kill yourself -- yourselves.

137
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.187
Of course not, Morty. How could that profit me?

138
00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.855
But someone out there is killing Ricks,

139
00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.690
and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me

140
00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:08.559
until we clear our names -- by finding the real Rick-killer.

141
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.728
I'm scared, Rick.

142
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.296
Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons,

143
00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:12.898
like that show "doomsday preppers".

144
00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.332
Not really my style, Morty.

145
00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:17.264
Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now.

146
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.463
All right, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls,

147
00:07:21.488 --> 00:07:24.208
this device is gonna trace his location.

148
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.112
You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer.

149
00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:28.146
Who wants lemonade?

150
00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:29.614
Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.517
Mmm! Oh! Delicious!

152
00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.019
Beth you're a treasure.

153
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:37.355
I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what?

154
00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.225
She's not as brilliant or attractive.

155
00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:43.328
Aw. Thank you.

156
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.263
Oh! She did! She did it!

157
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.379
H-hello?

158
00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:54.339
- Hey, Jerry, it's Rick. - Rick! Hey.

159
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:55.207
What's -- what's up?

160
00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:58.242
So, listen, the heat's on, and there's nowhere left to turn,

161
00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:01.475
so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole.

162
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.681
- What?! - Is that cool with you, dawg?

163
00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:03.515
Rick, no!

164
00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:05.050
- Morty!! - We got it.

165
00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:06.384
The call's coming from...

166
00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:08.386
âª inside the house âª

167
00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.055
Look at his face! You dummy!

168
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.224
Can't believe our daughter married you.

169
00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:13.258
Too easy!

170
00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:17.028
The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry.

171
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.230
They won't be able to help themselves.

172
00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:20.098
But as soon as they get bored, they'll be onto us.

173
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.501
Phones Ã  la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls.

174
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.103
- Anything else? - Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

175
00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:26.037
Right away, sir.

176
00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.740
You know, Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys,

177
00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:31.076
I thought, "Gee, that kind of devalues our bond".

178
00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:33.945
But then I realized it just means that our relationship must

179
00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:36.814
be pretty special to span over all those different timelines.

180
00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.049
Yeah, it's got to be that way.

181
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.685
- You're a camouflage. - Camouflage?

182
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:42.187
What are you talking about, Rick?

183
00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:45.357
Ricks have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius.

184
00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.926
The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near

185
00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:50.725
someone with complementary brain waves that make ours invisible.

186
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:53.297
See, when a Rick is with a Morty,

187
00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:56.869
the genius waves get canceled out by the, uh...

188
00:08:57.838 --> 00:08:59.039
...Morty waves.

189
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:02.508
Um... Because o-our personalities are so different?

190
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.276
Oh, shit, dawg.

191
00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:06.345
My portal gun was hacked remotely, Morty--

192
00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:08.379
obviously by the real killer, to frame me.

193
00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.914
But I was able to trace the signal.

194
00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.249
Come on. Let's go.

195
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.285
- Uh-oh. - Excuse me.

196
00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:15.320
We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location.

197
00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:18.089
They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion,

198
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.091
I'm gonna mark us each with a red "X" right now.

199
00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:22.794
That way, if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot

200
00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:25.797
the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying.

201
00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.800
Hey, check it out.

202
00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:30.068
Damn it!

203
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.941
- Hey, you didn't pay your bill! - The red "X"! Red "X"!

204
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.609
Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats

205
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.511
and your favorite kind of shirt in stock, huh, Morty?

206
00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.147
Yeah, Rick, I-I heard you the first time.

207
00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:43.815
You don't have to keep saying it over and over.

208
00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:45.784
Man, this place is way off the grid.

209
00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:47.152
This guy does not want to be found.

210
00:09:47.154 --> 00:09:48.320
Well, if he's a Rick,

211
00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:50.288
doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide?

212
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.490
I mean, isn't that what Mortys are -- human cloaking devices?

213
00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:55.927
Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is.

214
00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:58.930
Oh, my God, Rick, look!

215
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.366
There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building!

216
00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:04.869
Not people, Morty -- Mortys.

217
00:10:11.107 --> 00:10:12.379
Oh, God!

218
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:15.347
W-w-why would somebody do this? It's horrible!

219
00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:17.048
Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats,

220
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.050
but you get -- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and

221
00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:20.218
put them in agonizing pain,

222
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.488
that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks [beep].

223
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.858
I fiddled with a concept like this once.

224
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.960
On paper, Morty. On paper.

225
00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.162
I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill.

226
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.397
I mean, you could accomplish the same result with, like,

227
00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.233
five Mortys and a jumper cable.

228
00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:38.778
Which I also wouldn't do!

229
00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.206
I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship.

230
00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:42.874
- Coffee time! - Yeah!

231
00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:43.541
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

232
00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:45.778
That's what I like to hear!

233
00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.147
- Hi, Jerry. - Leave me alone.

234
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.081
I'm working.

235
00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:51.049
Oh, you are?

236
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:53.051
W-w-w-what do you do?

237
00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.220
I-I'm -- I'm in between advertising jobs.

238
00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:57.188
Advertising? Wow!

239
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.423
So, people need help figuring

240
00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:00.525
out what to buy, and then y-y-you help 'em?

241
00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.424
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.

242
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.829
Well, I mean, you do it,

243
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.265
and you seem like a guy who really has it all together.

244
00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:14.072
Dude, are you -- w-- you're being a dick, right?

245
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.875
Oh, gosh, I-I hope not. I wouldn't want to offend you in any way.

246
00:11:16.877 --> 00:11:19.411
You're really a Rick?

247
00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:22.881
Y-- of course I am -- just as much as my Morty's a Morty.

248
00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:26.580
Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie "mask."

249
00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:28.386
You know, the one with Cher in it?

250
00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:29.421
That's right, Jerry!

251
00:11:29.423 --> 00:11:31.089
He -- he's from a reality where

252
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:33.191
everyone is Eric Stoltz "mask" people.

253
00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.559
He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty.

254
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:36.227
They assigned him to me because

255
00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:37.896
I never had any kids of my own.

256
00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:39.397
But if I did, boy, I'd love them

257
00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:40.932
if they were as smart and as

258
00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.367
successful as you are, Jerry.

259
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.902
Hey, get a load of this.

260
00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:45.937
Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick.

261
00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:47.372
This is perfect.

262
00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.940
I'm not doofus Rick!

263
00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:50.241
I'm Rick j19-zeta-7!

264
00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:52.977
Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop?

265
00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:55.146
Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?

266
00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.414
Hey, I don't eat poop!

267
00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:58.850
Y-you guys are always so mean to me.

268
00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.421
I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry.

269
00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:04.989
I'm the worst Rick of them all.

270
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:07.392
According to who -- other versions of you?

271
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.993
If I've learned one thing,

272
00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:10.928
it's that before you get anywhere in life,

273
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.597
you got to stop listening to yourself.

274
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:14.432
Wow. You really are wise, Jerry.

275
00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:16.634
I-I-I guess that's why you work in advertising.

276
00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:20.472
The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.

277
00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:22.640
You don't care about me at all!

278
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:25.143
I'm no different than that jacket you've got on!

279
00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:27.345
Y-y-y-- o-or your stupid portal gun!

280
00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:28.246
I'm just a tool!

281
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.314
I-I-I'm just an object!

282
00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:32.016
Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty.

283
00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:33.618
Now, for the love of God, be quiet.

284
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.286
The point of this is to get the drop on the guy.

285
00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:37.088
You know what, Rick? I'll tell you something!

286
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.289
I'm more than a human shield!

287
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:39.457
Yeah, that's right.

288
00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:40.024
You are.

289
00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:42.460
You're a perfect, impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty,

290
00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:43.662
because you're as dumb as I am

291
00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:45.430
smart, which is why when I say

292
00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.432
"shut up," it's really good advice.

293
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.903
Great. Nice work, Morty.

294
00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:07.152
Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

295
00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:09.020
You -- aren't you a tough customer.

296
00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:10.288
The slow clap? Really?

297
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.389
Kind of played out, dude.

298
00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:13.191
Not in this dimension, it isn't.

299
00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:14.959
In fact I invented it.

300
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.061
Nobody else has ever even done it here before.

301
00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:18.196
Well, la-di-da.

302
00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:19.531
Hey, that's mine!

303
00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:27.038
I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty.

304
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.673
- We got to escape. - I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

305
00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:30.875
- Y-you're a monster. - Don't be Rick-diculous, Morty.

306
00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:33.044
Will you -- will you stop saying that?

307
00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:33.912
It's stupid.

308
00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:35.313
Take his Morty away.

309
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.247
Come with me.

310
00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:37.682
Yeah, gladly.

311
00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:40.018
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

312
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.053
Hey, man, you seem to know how this place works.

313
00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.255
Is there any way we could shut

314
00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:45.890
down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside?

315
00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:47.091
It would be pointless.

316
00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:50.261
Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick.

317
00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.396
In here.

318
00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:02.707
- Ah. Isn't it beautiful? - Yeah, yeah.

319
00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:05.109
Looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here.

320
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:05.710
Zing!

321
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.414
- That guy got it. - Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet.

322
00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:11.382
You're missing my symphony.

323
00:14:13.253 --> 00:14:16.287
Hey, I'll take it over Mumford & Sons.

324
00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:17.055
Zip!

325
00:14:17.757 --> 00:14:18.857
This guy is on it!

326
00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:20.925
He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick.

327
00:14:20.927 --> 00:14:24.295
That's just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds.

328
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.133
You see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are.

329
00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.435
I wanted you to find me.

330
00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:32.937
We're not so different, you and I.

331
00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:34.072
Yeah, duh!

332
00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:35.773
See this right here, Rick?

333
00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:36.975
I crunched the numbers.

334
00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.143
I created a spectrum of all the Ricks.

335
00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:41.946
I listed them out from most evil to least evil.

336
00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:42.981
Here's where I am.

337
00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:45.750
And look it -- right here's where you are, Rick.

338
00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:47.385
This guy right here -- super-weird.

339
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.219
I get it.

340
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.387
So you want me to team up with

341
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.289
you to take down the council of Ricks, right?

342
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.957
Is that where you're going with this?

343
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.292
'Cause that's where I'd be going.

344
00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:54.926
Please.

345
00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:57.095
I think I'm doing pretty good on my own.

346
00:14:57.097 --> 00:14:58.463
I'm simply gonna download the

347
00:14:58.465 --> 00:15:02.333
contents of your brain and then kill you.

348
00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:04.269
Okay, if we add a little more

349
00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:07.805
titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate...

350
00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:11.276
...Ovenless brownies!

351
00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:13.077
Mmm. Mmm!

352
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.312
It's incredible what a gifted

353
00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:16.481
mind can accomplish when priorities are in order.

354
00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:17.348
Well, come on.

355
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.150
I can't take all the credit, Jerry.

356
00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:21.986
- It was your idea. - Come here, Jerry!

357
00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:27.759
Hey, uh, come here.

358
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.194
I-I want to show you something.

359
00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:32.896
Okay, look, everybody makes fun of me for getting these,

360
00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.299
but you're a genius scientist.

361
00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:35.499
What do you think? See?

362
00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:39.203
There's little R2-D2s where the George Washingtons should be.

363
00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:42.140
You know, Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that these will

364
00:15:42.142 --> 00:15:44.809
increase in value or even hold their current value.

365
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.312
The truth is, you bought them because you like them.

366
00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:48.479
They have value to you.

367
00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:50.348
That's what matters.

368
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.421
- How long are you staying? - Until we find your Rick.

369
00:15:56.523 --> 00:16:00.423
I found mine.

370
00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:05.097
- Help! - There is no escape, my son.

371
00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:07.931
We will find our peace in the next world.

372
00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:10.001
So, what -- you're just gonna give up?

373
00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:13.471
We're giving in -- to the power of the one true Morty.

374
00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:15.139
One day, he will return.

375
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.610
Praise the one true Morty.

376
00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:20.912
Ugh.

377
00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:22.847
All right, Mortys, listen up.

378
00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:26.551
My name is Morty Smith, from earth dimension C-137.

379
00:16:26.553 --> 00:16:29.087
I know you're scared, because I'm scared.

380
00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.389
But that's no reason to accept our fate!

381
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:32.256
We're Mortys!

382
00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:35.026
We're not defined by our relationships to Rick!

383
00:16:35.028 --> 00:16:37.328
Our destiny is our own!

384
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.031
This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.

385
00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.532
I'm sick of being a human shield.

386
00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.568
I want to be a gardener!

387
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.071
I want to write really crazy, intense action novels!

388
00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:49.207
I'm more than just a hammer!

389
00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.175
He is the one true Morty!

390
00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.076
Hooray!

391
00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:53.544
The one true Morty!

392
00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:55.413
Hey, keep it down!

393
00:17:04.751 --> 00:17:07.559
You've lived quite a life, Rick.

394
00:17:07.561 --> 00:17:10.762
It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.

395
00:17:18.764 --> 00:17:23.107
- You're crying? Over a Morty? - No, I'm just allergic to dipshits.

396
00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.108
Ugh. Pathetic.

397
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.876
We both know that if there's any truth in the universe,

398
00:17:26.978 --> 00:17:29.648
it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys.

399
00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:35.219
Do your worst, you little bastards!

400
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.454
Kill me! Do it!

401
00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:38.156
Do I-I-I-I-it!

402
00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:40.091
Morty! Thank God!

403
00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:41.459
Get me out of this.

404
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:42.060
Come on!

405
00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.928
You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

406
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.331
Point taken, but this is no time for arcs.

407
00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:50.435
Oh!

408
00:17:56.007 --> 00:17:56.507
Yeah, hello.

409
00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.910
Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?

410
00:17:58.912 --> 00:17:59.977
Huh? W-who is this?

411
00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:02.313
I found the real killer, bitch!

412
00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:03.881
Get over here!

413
00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:09.220
Yo, ding-dong, we're done here. Time to go.

414
00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:13.091
Well, Jerry, I guess this means goodbye.

415
00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.992
W-w-well, does it have to?

416
00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:17.095
I mean, you -- you look just like Rick.

417
00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:19.297
We could maybe, you know, get rid of him.

418
00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.332
I'm not saying kill him, necessarily.

419
00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:22.600
I -- I'm also not saying

420
00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.535
necessarily not kill him, but --

421
00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:27.271
Jerry, w-we both know it wouldn't work.

422
00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.341
It's time to go back to our lives.

423
00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:32.477
I love you, Jerry. I love you.

424
00:18:48.355 --> 00:18:51.096
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

425
00:18:54.998 --> 00:18:57.836
W-what -- w-what's gonna happen to all these Mortys?

426
00:18:57.838 --> 00:19:00.404
They'll go back to their families, attend school

427
00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:04.041
regularly, play video games, date girls.

428
00:19:04.043 --> 00:19:07.211
Poor little rickless bastards.

429
00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:09.547
Earth Rick C-137, the council

430
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:11.149
apologizes for its false

431
00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.717
accusation, and in the way of

432
00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:14.552
reparations for our

433
00:19:14.554 --> 00:19:16.420
terrible mistake, we would like

434
00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.156
to compensate you with this

435
00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:19.991
voucher for a free replacement

436
00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.359
Morty in the event that

437
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:23.060
your current Morty should --

438
00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:25.396
Uh, guys, not a good time.

439
00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:27.098
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

440
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.603
Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

441
00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:34.705
I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device.

442
00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:35.439
Saved your ass.

443
00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:36.507
All right, Morty.

444
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.242
Don't break an arm jerking yourself off.

445
00:19:38.244 --> 00:19:40.077
Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

446
00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:41.245
That right there, that w-- that

447
00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:44.081
was a great opportunity to show a little humanity, you know?

448
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:46.650
- To connect with me a little. - Hey, Morty, you want connection,

449
00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:49.219
go be part of some stupid club, like all those dumb Ricks.

450
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:51.722
You know, maybe I don't connect because I'm the rickest Rick there is.

451
00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:53.090
And, you know, it would

452
00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:54.592
g-- Go without saying

453
00:19:54.594 --> 00:19:57.261
that the rickest Rick would have the Mortyest Morty.

454
00:19:57.263 --> 00:20:00.598
- It would go without saying, huh? - Yeah, it would.

455
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.401
- Did you hear me say it? - Nah.

456
00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:04.402
The Mortyest Morty.

457
00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:07.371
Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster brown.

458
00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:09.540
A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems.

459
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.576
It can be a real bad thing for everybody.

460
00:20:11.578 --> 00:20:13.244
Oh, yeah? How's that?

461
00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:16.247
U-uh, I'll explain when you're older.

462
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:20.451
- What a mess. - Pride cometh before the fall.

463
00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:22.386
I guess he got what he deserved.

464
00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.287
What is that?

465
00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:26.123
Hand me the laser difibulator.

466
00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:27.792
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

467
00:20:27.794 --> 00:20:29.160
No! Go clean the toilets.

468
00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:31.095
Maybe you'll make friends with some turds.

469
00:20:31.097 --> 00:20:33.397
You make us ashamed to be ourselves!

470
00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:39.080
My God. I've seen this technology before.

471
00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.305
This Rick was being controlled remotely --

472
00:20:41.307 --> 00:20:42.673
puppeteered by somebody else.

473
00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:43.774
This is the receiver.

474
00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:46.744
Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

475
00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:38.763
- Wubba dubba dub dub! - Oh. Hey, Jerry.

476
00:21:38.765 --> 00:21:40.732
What are you doing in my room, buddy?

477
00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:44.368
Nothing. I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors.

478
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.536
All right.

479
00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:47.071
Okay, get out.

480
00:22:09.073 --> 00:22:12.129
What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him?

481
00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:13.731
You know he eats his own shit, right?

482
00:22:13.733 --> 00:22:15.666
Oh, my God, this is rich!

483
00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:18.569
I've got like 10 Ricks to call right now.
