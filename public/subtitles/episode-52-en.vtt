1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.720
Ugh, guess this is how it ends.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.799
I thought I was better than this.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.260
Dramatic voiceover while stranded in space?

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.670
I-I guess when you're dying,

5
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.310
the first thing to go is your creativity.

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.391
Citadel's gone...

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.720
and... and the saucer we escaped in is out of power...

8
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.320
Aw, man, I'm so scared in here.

9
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.950
The extra Mortys went feral.

10
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.149
Eh, some problems solve themselves.

11
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.290
Been drinking a lot.

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.020
Morty! I told you to write this down!

13
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.040
I-I don't have a helmet like that Avengers guy did.

14
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.200
Been drinking a lot of my piss.

15
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.020
Portal gun's still broken.

16
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.060
Guess that was all part of Evil Morty's plan.

17
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.582
"Evil Morty." Can we stop flattering this guy?

18
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.500
His "plan" was to monologue and fuck off.

19
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.840
He basically threw a tantrum

20
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.510
to announce he was quitting Twitter.

21
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.140
Nobody quits Twitter.

22
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.040
Hey, remember like a second ago

23
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.280
when you pretended not to know who Iron Man was?

24
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.240
- Who was that for? - Shh, shh, shush, Morty.

25
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.750
This is how we go. Bear it with grace.

26
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.920
Spinal cord... Robitussin as a base, then surprise me.

27
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.364
- Mom! - Beth maybe!

28
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370
Is she trying to say something?

29
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.700
We... We can't hear you!

30
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.520
How dumb are... Beth, you're in a vacuum!

31
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.999
Sound travels on air! Why am I yelling?

32
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.628
_

33
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.880
- Wow, great. - Yeah, that's... Wow, really worth it.

34
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.717
That was not worth it! It's corny. You. Corn.

35
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.880
Dying of starvation here!

36
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.280
- _ - Oh, my God. Stop explaining.

37
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.500
Stop explaining!

38
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160
- Are you finished? - _

39
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.349
She's not finished.

40
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.369
_

41
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.395
- Oh, real mature, r-real classy. - Oh, nice.

42
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.500
It was a good line, honey.

43
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.359
I didn't need it to be. I don't care what you think.

44
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.700
Oh, my God, she found you. Here, eat, eat, eat.

45
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.990
- Oh, hell yes! - Hold on, buddy,

46
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.080
our systems could go into shock from solid food.

47
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.860
Digestibot, convert to nutrient mass.

48
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.380
I'm just gonna risk it.

49
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.860
- Mmm. - Since when you do you guys get stranded?

50
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.000
- Thank you, by the way. - Almost left them out there.

51
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.290
Portal travel's broken.

52
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.160
Mmm, are these heirloom tomatoes?

53
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.800
Digestibot, try these.

54
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.000
- Yum. Yum. - So you can't hop realities anymore.

55
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.079
Does that mean you'll finally have to wash your robe?

56
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.719
Good point, I need to reboot the portal index immediately.

57
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.210
Basically just a hard reset on the fluid.

58
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.280
Hold tight, the Earth's gonna shake a bit.

59
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.140
- Um... - Oh!

60
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.420
- Ohh, shit. - Wait, what? W-What's happening?

61
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.830
Instead of resetting portal travel,

62
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.260
I may have reset portal travelers.

63
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.820
Too late to apologize.

64
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.140
Rick, why am I pulsing green?

65
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.419
And don't say you don't know because you're pulsing green.

66
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.700
Rick, are we about to die?

67
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.409
No, we're about to vanish from this reality.

68
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.180
- That's totally dying! - No, it isn't.

69
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.174
It's everyone from this reality returning to their reality of origin.

70
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.140
- Back to our original universes? - I explained it fine, Morty.

71
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.410
You're spoonfeeding spoons!

72
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.120
- W-Where's Summer? - Oh, nice, you guys are back. Whoa.

73
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.940
Summer, three of us are one-way blind hopping.

74
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.140
You gotta help us get back.

75
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.959
There's a protocol for this in your chore server,

76
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.140
filename Booger AIDS.

77
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.580
Every file is Booger AIDS!

78
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.680
I-I hate naming things!

79
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.160
Just search for words like "one way blind hop reset nav beacon."

80
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.660
Why do I have a "reality of origin?"

81
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.000
There's no time to explain, Jerry! Counting on you, Summer!

82
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.940
One way blind hop beacon protocol!

83
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.280
Here we gooooo!

84
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.770
So there was time to explain.

85
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.230
Don't waste extra precious seconds

86
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.109
with your pettiness, Jerry! Summer, let's run down...

87
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.540
One way blind hop reset beacon booger AIDS.

88
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.600
Cool.

89
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.450
- Wow. - There was so much time to explain!

90
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.200
Yes! Fine, hindsight is 20-20!

91
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.779
Who has ever taken this long to vanish?

92
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.260
How did I end up not in my own universe?!

93
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.920
Oh, my God. The Jerryboree!

94
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.069
- Ohhhhhhhh, the Jerryboree. - Ohhhhhhhh, the Jerryboree.

95
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.160
Deep cut.

96
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.670
Wait, but where's our real Dad and our real Morty?

97
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.280
Buried in the backyard!

98
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.486
That's what the possums are after.

99
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.490
Dad's got you in the family business too, huh?

100
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.740
Yeah, Morty's an easy mark, but Rick pays me in things like...

101
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.248
Wolverine claws.

102
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.550
Whelp, looks like you got this.

103
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.584
See you guys in another two years?

104
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.920
Or you could stick around for this one?

105
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.840
Looks like it involves Grandpa's grody citadel.

106
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.007
We could, you know, break things, loot stuff.

107
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.000
Should probably get back to... saving the galaxy.

108
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.400
Please!

109
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.609
Uh... Guess I could loot some stuff.

110
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.819
Fine, yeah, okay, let's make it quick.

111
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.580
Awesome, I've never been. Let's do this.

112
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.640
Okay, adventure family! Whoo!

113
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.606
Uh, okay.

114
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.020
Fuck.

115
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.350
Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.

116
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.860
Rick? Is that you?

117
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.544
Yeah... Diane.

118
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.200
You've been gone so long.

119
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.000
- Did you find our daughter's killer? - Not yet, sorry. Still looking.

120
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.080
You'll find him.

121
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.240
You always do everything you set your mind to.

122
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.000
Except keep your family alive.

123
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.560
But that was hardly your fault!

124
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.910
Mute.

125
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.250
If I could be muted,

126
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.659
I wouldn't be too-too-too good at haunting you,

127
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.140
would I, you dirty bear?

128
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.080
Yeah, forgot I wanted to be haunted.

129
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.692
I guess you predicted you might.

130
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.860
That's where haunting comes in handy, huh?

131
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.946
Very good point, sugar.

132
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.080
Rick?

133
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.500
Hello? Original family?

134
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.130
Sorry about last time.

135
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.172
Rick, he was in space prison.

136
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.299
W-We couldn't just... hello?

137
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.934
Aw, geez.

138
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.161
Ahh.

139
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.810
Ah, fuck.

140
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.126
Damn it, Morty, there's no doctors anymore.

141
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.378
Dad?

142
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.883
Figures it's underwhelming the one time I visit.

143
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.900
Yeah, sorry,

144
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.428
usually there's cowboy Rick and Mortys and stuff.

145
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.059
Oh, looks like they could use

146
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.260
a couple repairman Rick and Mortys, right?

147
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.860
Oh, tight, little scavenger dudes!

148
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.770
If they shoot at us, I'm allowed to...

149
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.700
... do this.

150
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.320
Shit, yeah!

151
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.653
Space Mom, get in on this!

152
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.940
Cool Mom!

153
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.660
Let's keep it moving. I don't have all day.

154
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.560
I got it!

155
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.480
I got it! I got it!

156
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.220
Sorry!

157
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.300
Sorry!

158
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.820
I got it. Sorry!

159
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.750
I was gonna do it.

160
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.427
Ugh. Terrestrials, am I right?

161
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.690
I kept up the search in your absence.

162
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.790
You want a new list of potential locations?

163
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.320
You're always just one room away, huh?

164
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.852
Yeah, uh, remember?

165
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.850
You thought if you could see or touch me,

166
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.120
it might give you a level of com-com-comfort.

167
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.880
Right. Can't have that.

168
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.070
Come on, Summer.

169
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.340
Who's Summer? Should I be jealous?

170
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.780
I hope Summer knows what happens to the people you love!

171
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.328
Hey, Rick!

172
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.690
Hey, Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian.

173
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.580
S-Still alive, huh? W-What's up?

174
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.731
I was wondering if you could help me make sense of a note

175
00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:22.060
I found this morning?

176
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.382
It's written by someone claiming to be me.

177
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.060
They say my mind is held captive in a time loop,

178
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.280
trapped in the day of a traumatic event

179
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.890
by the agony of a formidable intelligence.

180
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.130
But also that my captor forgot about aging...

181
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.936
that my body spoils and yearns for death

182
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.380
while my soul remains stuck in place,

183
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.066
caught like a fly in amber.

184
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.401
Right. I used to drink drink.

185
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.740
- Uh, no clue, pal. - That's okay.

186
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.920
I found other notes in the trash just like it.

187
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.890
Poor weirdo. I pity them.

188
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.510
Wish they could let go and move on.

189
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.340
- Sounds healthy. - Sure would be!

190
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.920
Ohhhhhh!

191
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.501
Sweet death.

192
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.173
Was that symbolic?

193
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.643
Are you letting go?

194
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.880
I understand, baby. I forgive you...

195
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.983
You don't get to say that! You're not her.

196
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.250
You're a thing I built to torture myself.

197
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.270
This whole fucking timeline is cursed.

198
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.305
I gotta get out of here.

199
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.932
Because you want to move on.

200
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.400
Because I don't.

201
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.180
And I have to.

202
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.900
I came back on accident.

203
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.180
Guy I'm looking for, he's... he's not findable, Diane.

204
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.790
I live with a version of Beth, now.

205
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.890
Sounds like a version of nice.

206
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.090
We have grandkids. Tha... That's who Summer is.

207
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.930
She's gonna get me out of here.

208
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.200
She reminds me of you.

209
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.540
Oh, really? Is she dead too?

210
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.230
Bye, Diane.

211
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.080
You're not honestly gonna fly into that rift

212
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.700
without coordinates, are you?

213
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.293
Don't give up on us, Rick!

214
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.740
I don't make the rules!

215
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.440
Haunters gonna haunt!

216
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.930
Baby? Are you killing yourself?

217
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.960
I'm more embracing the "win-win" of risking my life.

218
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.830
- Where's Mom and Summer? - Oh, they're gone.

219
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.780
- Sorry, Morty. - Gone gone?

220
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.130
We spent a long time in that ice.

221
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.245
A gentle mutant licked us out, but Beth got sick, and Summer...

222
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.560
didn't thaw right.

223
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.710
With no one left to blame, I finally had to deal with myself.

224
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.680
Buried my grief at Barnes & Noble.

225
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.420
"Four Agreements," "Eat Pray Love,"

226
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.540
Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns."

227
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.230
Learned to accept things for what they are.

228
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.740
In a few of these, the whole brain is still intact.

229
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.729
Makes you wonder if some people were still in there,

230
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.560
just trapped in the horror.

231
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.290
Anyway, it's awesome protein.

232
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.460
I'm so sorry, Dad.

233
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.230
But my real, original Dad beat the apocalypse.

234
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.692
I-I-I guess we all underestimated you.

235
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.160
Hey, w-what's that game we always used to try to play as a family,

236
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.670
y... the one we never finished?

237
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.560
- Downbeat. - Yes! Let's play Downbeat.

238
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.910
I-I bet I can find it! We can finish now.

239
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.954
Yeah, you should totally do that.

240
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.126
Hey, yeah, cool, I-I got it!

241
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.927
We'll play Downbeat and we'll... we'll camp here tonight

242
00:11:08.928 --> 00:11:10.520
and then rebuild the house.

243
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.883
You know, we got food, fresh water,

244
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.690
and we've got family.

245
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.840
The fuck?

246
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.680
Morty. I wrote this note in advance

247
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.620
in case you're wondering how I left so fast.

248
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.440
My plan is to wait for you to turn your back,

249
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.520
then I'm going to grab all your shit and split.

250
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.079
Depending on how long you were out of the room,

251
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.619
you'll probably be thinking I can't be that far away

252
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.859
and you'll want to foll...

253
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.549
Morty, wrote this fast 'cause had to set trap.

254
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.559
Thought you'd have cooler shit.

255
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.170
- See other note, bye. - Motherfu...

256
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.304
Whoa-whoa! Slow down! Slow down!

257
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.780
Not cool! Oh!

258
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.950
What the hell, Dad?

259
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.280
Don't take it personal, Morty.

260
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.589
That's one of the Four Agreements.

261
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.699
I don't remember the other three,

262
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.400
but I know Commissioner Gordon was cool with Batman moving on.

263
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.260
Batman doesn't abandon people!

264
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.890
You abandoned us.

265
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.020
I deserve that.

266
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.053
But, you know, it... it improved you.

267
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.520
Oh, am I cool enough for you now?

268
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.750
Well, that was easy.

269
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.850
It only cost me fucking everything.

270
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.140
- Whoa, hey, I-I... - You came back and talked about us

271
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.720
like we weren't people, Morty!

272
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.564
Then you bailed and left us to freeze!

273
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.340
I-I was apologizing for that earlier...

274
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.020
Your mom and sister died, Morty!

275
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.840
And I moved on.

276
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.210
From caring.

277
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.680
And that is the best deal you will ever get.

278
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.900
- So take it. - Please don't go.

279
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.950
I-If Rick comes back, we ca... we can find you a new reality,

280
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.790
a new Mom, new Summer, a... job!

281
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.419
Oh, you don't get it, kid.

282
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.880
Except for this conversation, my life is perfect.

283
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.591
Rick was always right. Everyone needs to let go.

284
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.840
Aww, you came back.

285
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.770
I guess we really did form a bond.

286
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.140
Ow! Hey, stop it!

287
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.437
Get away from me! No, help!

288
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.900
All right, pin dropped, Grandpa!

289
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.310
Come and get us.

290
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.069
Come on, come on, come on!

291
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.530
Baby? Something to keep in mind...

292
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.950
If you were pulled home by whatever happened,

293
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.700
it's likely our target was, as well.

294
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.400
It's also likely he's having as much trouble leaving as you are.

295
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.580
He's trapped.

296
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.837
- Grandpa! - Oh, fuck yes!

297
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.580
Grandpa... Grandpa?

298
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.803
Summer! Gold star, always believed in you.

299
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.340
- N-Now the hard part. - Hard part?

300
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.500
Way worse things than me can see that beacon, too.

301
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.480
Hunker down and protect it while I grab Morty.

302
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.437
- Rick out! Try to survive! - Oh, shit.

303
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.105
Domestic Mom should hide maybe?

304
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.150
- "Domestic Mom"? - I mean, she's the cool space one.

305
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.060
Look, I'm not looking to get caught in whatever this is.

306
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.730
You guys can both hide maybe, hash it out.

307
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.000
Oh, quit talking down! I'm you with the patience to do laundry.

308
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.030
Mom, stop being jealous of our bond!

309
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.537
She ran from our choices. I have to parent them.

310
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.665
It's not like I didn't care. That's what the clone was for.

311
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.970
Aah!

312
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.126
Moms!

313
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.030
- Morty! - Rick?

314
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.860
I knew it! I knew you wouldn't leave me!

315
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.728
Ow! The fuck?

316
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.069
Morty, did you see another Rick here?

317
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.700
Nondescript haircut, sci-fi jacket?

318
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.920
Eh, of course you didn't see him, you'd be dead.

319
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.560
Or you'd be a bomb.

320
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.340
Do you feel bomby?

321
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.780
Nah, you woulda blown up by now.

322
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.140
Wasn't the Rick here dead?

323
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.840
Th-That's why you pick places, right?

324
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.740
Uh, well, your Rick, uh, yeah, not dead, more like not around.

325
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.480
When I met you, I was sorta hoping he might turn up one day.

326
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.168
You son of a bitch! I got you!

327
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.170
W-W-Where are we going?

328
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.900
To kill your grandpa, little buddy.

329
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.591
Wait, what? I don't understand.

330
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.800
My original Rick killed your family?

331
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.369
And you were just waiting for him to come back?

332
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.890
Seems like you understand fine, Morty.

333
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.306
That was A+ re-piping.

334
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.460
We're here.

335
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.520
This guy, Morty, he hates being found,

336
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.100
but loves building elaborate shit.

337
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.839
Like... Like... Like playing a ton of "Minecraft,"

338
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.000
but all on a private server.

339
00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.693
Am I in a fucking K-hole right now?

340
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.020
What is going on?

341
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.116
Whoa, hoho, you found me!

342
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.210
I shoot the first monitor, too.

343
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.850
Listen, I'm not here.

344
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.372
Or am I?

345
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.380
There's the clone you found.

346
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.850
Or maybe it's me, all naked!

347
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.660
Just a Lil Keyser Soze.

348
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.360
I mean, why would I admit it's not?

349
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.720
Oh-hoho, yeah! Look at him!

350
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.260
Look at him go, look at him dance.

351
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.590
O-Or me. Again, it might be me,

352
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.060
like a "Saw" thing. I'm very sneaky.

353
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.260
Here's a bunch of killbots to deal with while ya wrestle with that.

354
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.719
Obviously, I don't know who I'm talking to here.

355
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.080
It's all prerecorded.

356
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.140
But if you got this far,

357
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.110
you probably think you're real special.

358
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.260
Tell you what...

359
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.380
Oop! There he goes!

360
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.000
Maybe that actually was me!

361
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.380
If you follow him down there, we can do a big fight.

362
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.300
50% chance I'm not lying.

363
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.020
We're in trouble, asshole!

364
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.330
I shouldn't have to beg.

365
00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.060
- Wait, my moms are in trouble? - Those versions of them are.

366
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.755
W-We gotta save them! Rick, this is an obvious trap.

367
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.600
If you go down there, he's just gonna kill you.

368
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.080
- Good! - What?

369
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.080
Now what?!

370
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.510
If you don't care if you die, why do you care if I die?

371
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.270
Knock it off! Get out of here!

372
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.800
You did this last season! You're like a suicide bomber!

373
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.020
Takes one to know one.

374
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.180
Yeah, well, you get it from him, not me.

375
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.780
I don't know him. You're my grandpa, Rick.

376
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.236
Rick and Morty. A hundred years.

377
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.919
This place totally might go up, by the way.

378
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.460
Here's a bunch of countdowns.

379
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.360
One of them's probably accurate.

380
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.030
Ah, fucking stupid 5th-dimensional stomach juices.

381
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.082
Sorry for the sitcom fight, and maybe getting us digested.

382
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.500
You've got incredible timing.

383
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.080
Oh, don't be a bitch. I'm parenting.

384
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.500
Makes sense you don't recognize it.

385
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.079
You've been out of practice for a while.

386
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.600
Good! I'm glad that they have you!

387
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.440
I don't want to be "Space Mom."

388
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.610
You've made that clear.

389
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.580
Just don't let Summer mistake your rejection of her for good taste.

390
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.800
I'm not trying to. It's all her!

391
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.410
Jesus! It'd be cool if you were around more.

392
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.960
I don't wanna get married.

393
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.440
I'm 17. My affection is the wind.

394
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.240
Don't try to compete for it.

395
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.280
I could hear every word of that through the helmets.

396
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.330
Thank fuck I only had to kill most of them.

397
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.260
Jesus, that ship really has sailed.

398
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.126
And now we feast!

399
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.820
This emergency was oversold to me.

400
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:27.840
- Grandpa! - Morty!

401
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.360
Moms! Wait, i-if they had to wear helmets...

402
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.420
I do childproofing stuff while you're asleep.

403
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.820
Why don't you childproof Dad?

404
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.980
- Ah, great reminder. - Wait!

405
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.558
- Time to get Jerry. - Ugh.

406
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.760
Maybe I wouldn't be so uptight If I wasn't married

407
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.600
to an unemployed receptacle of human fear!

408
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.560
Get a job, Dad, it's been a decade.

409
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.760
Woof. Pretty brutal, Jer.

410
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.695
I-I know a good alligator park if you wanna kill yourself.

411
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.979
I got expelled today.

412
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.639
- What the hell, Morty?! You got expelled! - Oh, no, you got expelled.

413
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.199
- Whoa, what a horrible thing. - You are so fucking dumb!

414
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.070
- Too bad, Morty. - Hi, hon.

415
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.180
Woof,

416
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.680
some real Season 2 vibes in there, you know what I'm sayin'?

417
00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.380
You know, never thought I'd say this,

418
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.780
but I think I'm glad we spent that time divorced.

419
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.800
Er, one second.

420
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.599
I'll build a fucking swing set in the backyard!

421
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.140
You know, I may technically be from here.

422
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.680
But I'm a goddamn interdimensional traveler now.

423
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.930
And all of you can kiss my sci-fi ass.

424
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.060
It gets me every time.

425
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.600
Wow, what an amazing joke I just told.

426
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.700
A-And also, what an adventure.

427
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.359
You know, I guess it doesn't matter where we're from

428
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.680
if we're together, huh?

429
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.440
Good... Good final moral thing.

430
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.750
This is everyone's "original dimension" now.

431
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.910
Great wrap-ups, kids.

432
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.662
- Ugh, you're back. - Oh, shit, Season 2 Jerry!

433
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.930
Look, before you bust my balls,

434
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.350
can someone help with the shower?

435
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.333
It's colder than Beth on our anniversary.

436
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.680
Also, look who I found in Rick's room.

437
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.629
Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

438
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.900
I don't care how cute he is.

439
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.600
We agreed no boogens in the house.

440
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.400
Wait, Season 2 Jerry, don't!

441
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.110
- Whoa! - Mr. Frundles!

442
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.136
Everybody in the car.

443
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.510
Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

444
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.510
Wait, but I thought he was Mr. Frundles.

445
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.320
Everybody in the car! Now!

446
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.260
Nyah! Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

447
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.270
- Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles! - Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

448
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.230
What the fuck, Dad?!

449
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.859
Why would you bring that thing into our house?

450
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.420
It was cute! Fuck.

451
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.920
We gotta find a new timeline now!

452
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.880
You know how hard that shit is without portals?

453
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.490
We gotta do the thing with the Rift and the beacon again!

454
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.590
The whole fucking episode all over again!

455
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.760
Car, fabricate some vomit bags.

456
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.700
Can't we just go back and fix it?

457
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.797
Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

458
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.960
I can't believe portal travel's broken.

459
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.340
I'll get to it when I get to it.

460
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.519
Lift with your knees, Mom.

461
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.390
How many times have you done this?

462
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.740
Oh, God.

463
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.520
And you swear they die of natural causes?

464
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.420
- Mm-hmm, yep. - The exact same as our old timeline?

465
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.229
- Even my stuff? - Bit of a rush job, actually,

466
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.420
so they do say "Parmesan" weird.

467
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.340
- How do they say... - Par-mees-ian.

468
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.590
- Boo. - Jesus Christ.

469
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.650
I could've left you guys!

470
00:19:57.651 --> 00:19:59.672
You think the concept of "family" matters to me?

471
00:19:59.673 --> 00:20:00.785
I'm not even your Rick!

472
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:01.980
- Uh-huh. - "I'm Denial Rick!"

473
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.580
See you inside, Dad.

474
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.260
Sorry I was such a Dance Mom about Summer.

475
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.770
- She's your daughter, too. - No, boundaries are good.

476
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.240
But, uh, speaking of, maybe I've put up too many.

477
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.380
Is it okay if I come around sometimes?

478
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.580
That could be nice.

479
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:18.511
- That's a cute outfit. - The one we always wear?

480
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.320
Yes, Morty?

481
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.320
You promise I'm not, you know, bait?

482
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.740
- T-To make that Rick come back? - What? M-Morty, for you to be bait,

483
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.260
the guy'd have to value something.

484
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.652
He truly does not give a shit.

485
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.160
He's the real deal.

486
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.340
- Parmeee-san. - Par-meees-ian.

487
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.130
Par-mees-ian.

488
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.020
- Par... Parmeeeeeesian. - Parmesian.

489
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.664
- Gross. I hate it. - Yeah.

490
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.577
Hello? Morty?

491
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.850
That one big rat?

492
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.470
- Whoa, this is a development. - Gah!

493
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.100
Shh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

494
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.792
Lil guy, easy. You're a Jerry, right?

495
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.400
Never got too close to the concept.

496
00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.290
Boy, you have really arc'd out.

497
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.720
Were you putting on pants?

498
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.419
What? Oh, yeah, no, I was naked to fuck with a guy.

499
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.430
Speaking of, did you talk to me,

500
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.020
- or a little kid around here? - Maybe. Why?

501
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.770
Because if you hate them, too...

502
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.433
I could be down for a little team up.

503
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.020
Eh, I really don't "team up" anymore.

504
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.479
Managing people, such a headache. Aah!

505
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.640
Fatality...

506
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.410
Jerry wins.

507
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.600
Oh, goddamn dude. Badass!

508
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.320
Why are you here?

509
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.980
Buddy, I have been asking myself that exact same question.
