00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.205
âª Boob World, Boob World âª

2
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.668
âª It's a world for you, but it's actually two âª

3
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.477
âª Boob World! âª

4
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.959
I gotta say, Morty, it's weird that you wanted me to come,

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.900
but I'm actually exstyched about it...

6
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.119
that's excited, stoked, and psyched.

7
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.699
I didn't want you to come. Talk to Rick.

8
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.619
Truth is, Summer, Boob World's been at the center

9
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.000
of a few protests every day for 30 years,

10
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
so they've recently rebranded as a boob empowerment experience,

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.699
and if we bring a female, we get in for free.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.200
So, I'm, like, what, a Coke can you're taking to Six Flags?

13
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.840
No, 'cause once you get into Six Flags,

14
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.307
you can throw your Coke can away.

15
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.405
No fucking way.

16
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.838
It can't be.

17
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.760
- Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. - Oh, look at that.

18
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.220
- What is it? - It's a GoTron ferret.

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.938
It's not a GoTron ferret, Morty.

20
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.405
It's the blue GoTron ferret.

21
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.270
- Boob World is canceled. - No, Rick, no.

22
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.240
You promised. You always do this.

23
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.859
Tell you what, Morty, I'll let you choose.

24
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.419
- Do you really think Boob World... - Yes.

25
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.180
- Let me finish. Is more important... - Yes.

26
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.790
Let me finish! Than have all five of the only five GoTron ferrets

27
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.850
in the universe?

28
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.940
Are you finished? Yes. So, let's go.

29
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.519
Summer, help me hook the winch up to the ferret.

30
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.540
- Sure. - What the hell?!

31
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.068
You said you were letting me choose.

32
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.177
Yeah, whether to break my fucking heart.

33
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.707
You chose badly.

34
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.460
That's how it all began.

35
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.580
To my sister, it was just another game.

36
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.705
But what she didn't know...

37
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.560
That was the moment everything changed.

38
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.000
- Wait. What? - I had gotten my first taste of respect

39
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.270
and my first voiceover.

40
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.159
- I can hear you. Can you hear me? - And I knew then and there

41
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.146
I wanted more of both.

42
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.205
Hello?

43
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.199
Beth, Jerry, do something fun with us.

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.560
A giant monster is attacking in the Nibblenug system.

45
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.789
Your suits are in the bathroom.

46
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.920
Mine smells skeletony.

47
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.338
I have a chiropractor appointment.

48
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.671
What are you involving us in?

49
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.260
Rick's been collecting GoTron ferrets,

50
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.309
and now that he has all five, we can combine them into...

51
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.640
- Morty, for Christ's sake spoilers. - Spoilers, Morty.

52
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.019
We don't need to sell this to anyone.

53
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.649
There's a giant monster attacking.

54
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.800
In the Nibblenug system.

55
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.779
Since when does this house care about alien lives.

56
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.319
We don't even watch British television.

57
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.360
Told you. Let's just get Gene from next door

58
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.946
- and a homeless guy. - No. Hold on.

59
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.280
Fuck Gene. Fuck the homeless.

60
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.250
Your kids and their grandpa are asking you to do

61
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.638
an activity with them.

62
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.379
When did that stop being a parent's wettest dream?

63
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.540
I guess around the time our family created a giant incest baby,

64
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.471
and the government launched it into space.

65
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:52.480
Oh, my God, we made a giant incest baby.

66
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.007
Oh, my God, you might be a clone.

67
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.946
I exist because you guys failed to abort me.

68
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.900
We get the family we get, not the one we want.

69
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.600
And if you want to keep the one you got,

70
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.580
get your asses into some anime spacesuits.

71
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.660
- Fair enough. - Okay.

72
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.220
- Good work, Summer Camp. - Yeah.

73
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.320
I'm exci-toked about this.

74
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.346
Sure you are... now.

75
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.140
Something new was forming,

76
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.440
and I was at the bottom of it.

77
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.879
I let Morty have his voiceover.

78
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.140
It's really all he had left.

79
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.400
Okay, can you hear me or not?

80
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.020
Do you mean can I, Summer, hear you?

81
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.310
No. My voiceover can hear your voiceover.

82
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.140
- What's the difference? - One would be telepathy, dumbass.

83
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.420
- Now what? - Now, we...

84
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.120
Go, Team GoTron!

85
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.300
Where are we zip-lining through futuristic metallic tunnels to?

86
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.700
Each robot ferret is at a different location on Earth.

87
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.360
You're going to the center of a volcano.

88
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.360
Thank you?

89
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.260
- Okay, well, this isn't not fun. - Regroup on me.

90
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.559
I'll shoot a portal to Nibblenug.

91
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.000
Did I just monorail from my kitchen to Hawaii

92
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.980
just to regroup in outer space above my kitchen?

93
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.638
- Uh, Summer? - It's cool, Dad. Shut up.

94
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.420
Everybody, attack one at a time!

95
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.546
Is that the best way to...

96
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.871
Tee up something awesome? Yes. Follow me.

97
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.805
Guys, we did our best, but there's only one hope.

98
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.805
Activating link-dock. Inter-Morphs... rad-ified.

99
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.438
PostiTrinos... maximized.

100
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.430
Holy shit, I-I can't believe this is working.

101
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.438
Go, go, team! It's GoTron time!

102
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.320
- Oh, my God. Hell yes! - This is amazing!

103
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.799
Okay, now we can knock it around a little bit,

104
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.439
but trust me, we're still building to something.

105
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.659
- How do we... - Just hit buttons.

106
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.671
We're too big to fail.

107
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.850
I kicked him! That was me, right?

108
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.871
Uppercut!

109
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.500
I can't believe I almost went to the chiropractor!

110
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.205
I've been waiting a long time for this.

111
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.205
Form Luminous Energy Sword!

112
00:05:26.271 --> 00:05:28.371
That's your ass, Mamma Jamma.

113
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.160
I-I feel so alive.

114
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.860
These were the good times,

115
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.120
when we felt like we could do anything.

116
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.546
But anything is never quite everything.

117
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.800
And pretty soon...

118
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.620
That was nothing... nothing compared to what we can do.

119
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.960
There are infinite universes

120
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.579
where I still don't have all five ferrets.

121
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.871
Th-th-those versions of me

122
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.679
would do anything to complete their collections.

123
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.200
Okay, but Rick, remember what you told me to remind you?

124
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.538
Sometimes, enough is...

125
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.371
Sometimes, enough is enough.

126
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.677
Morty, what are you doing?

127
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.000
He gets obsessed, Summer.

128
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.205
- When are you going to find your shame? - I have more.

129
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.600
Grandpa just gave everybody the high point of their lives,

130
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.840
and before he did, every single one of you

131
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.338
was trying to talk him out of it.

132
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.171
Wait. Yeah. Wha-wha-what the fuck!

133
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.310
Now, he says we can go higher, and big surprise,

134
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.700
it's time to drag him down again.

135
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.420
- Well, I vote... - No voting. No debate.

136
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.320
It's not a democracy. It's a Rickpublic.

137
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.503
You're in or you're out.

138
00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:27.277
Obviously, I'm in. I never said I wasn't in.

139
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.380
Me, neither. Tell us what we're doing next.

140
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.849
Uh, I want to put together a cookout.

141
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.480
That's it? I was honestly prepared to blow someone.

142
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.838
- Jerry. - I said "prepared" and "someone."

143
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.169
Rick invited five versions of our family

144
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.820
from different universes, each with incomplete GoTrons.

145
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.099
I didn't have anyone to talk to,

146
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.838
since the other four Mortys had been to Boob World.

147
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.977
Did you walk on the beach?

148
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.070
The beach that's all boobs?

149
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.540
No, the beach that's all sand.

150
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.520
- Yes, the boob one! - Rick was in the garage

151
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.540
with the heads of the five families.

152
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.138
Ugh, and Summer.

153
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.371
In that first sit-down,

154
00:07:01.372 --> 00:07:02.390
it was Big Fat Rick,

155
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.420
Ricardo Montaya, Hot Head Rick...

156
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.649
he got that name because he was prone to dramatic outbursts,

157
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.140
and Lil' Ricky Wrap-it-Up,

158
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.940
who was always great at the end of a meeting.

159
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.400
At the head of it all, me and Grandpa Rick.

160
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.400
Now, don't get me wrong, C137,

161
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.100
we're happy for your good fortune.

162
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.780
But we did not travel to your universe

163
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.371
just to have it rubbed in our faces.

164
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.080
Come on, Big Fat Rick, you know your face

165
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.414
is too small to rub anything on.

166
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.405
My face is the same size as yours.

167
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.620
Wow. Huh. Hold on.

168
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.860
I'll be damned.

169
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.877
You're so fat you're an optical illusion.

170
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.980
Summer, give 'em the pitch.

171
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.760
We're offering to help each of your families

172
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.119
complete their full GoTrons.

173
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.070
In exchange for some concessions.

174
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.100
Ever since I was a little boy in the slums,

175
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.220
I have dreamed of having a complete GoTron.

176
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.480
But concessions?

177
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.680
I hope you mean the kind from a counter.

178
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.960
I hope she means ice cream!

179
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.100
We'd like you to relocate your families to this universe,

180
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.249
and let me make some modifications to the GoTrons...

181
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.671
in the interest of us all working together.

182
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.419
- Want to know what I think? - Sure, Hothead Rick,

183
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.571
just don't unexpectedly fly off the handle.

184
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.107
I think you guys got a lot of nerve acting better than us!

185
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.277
This is the family that made a giant incest baby!

186
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.240
Had the government launch it into space!

187
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.059
It's still floatin' around out there somewhere!

188
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.379
Are we ever gonna live that down?

189
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.920
If I get a full GoTron, it won't be by kissing your ass,

190
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.938
it'll be by taking what's mine... yours!

191
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.771
Hey! Gross! No need.

192
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.080
And you were driving... a ferret?

193
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.605
We all are, moron! Give me key!

194
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.400
You'll regret this, you level-headed fucks.

195
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.859
Obviously, we predicted that might happen,

196
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.900
which is why we have Yo-Yo Rick on standby.

197
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.138
Anybody got beef with Yo-Yo?

198
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.130
Some people think he's lame,

199
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.740
but to me, he's lame in a cool way because he owns it.

200
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.500
Cool. That concludes business. Lil' Ricky Wrap it Up?

201
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.780
Raise 'em up, boys! Oh-pah!

202
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.850
And so, we helped our people find their ferrets.

203
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.130
How they got them, not our problem.

204
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.800
Then, we got down to business.

205
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.946
Here's how it worked...

206
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.071
if a giant monster attacked your planet,

207
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.357
we all got the alert.

208
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.250
âª Hey, hey, mama mia's âª

209
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.800
âª Got a plate of spaghetti for the takin' âª

210
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.560
âª Papa pia's got a great big robot that he's makin' âª

211
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.005
âª I got the moon in both my eyes âª

212
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.657
âª You got a bowl of pizza pie, hey! âª

213
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.171
âª A bit of pasta with some anime combined, yeah âª

214
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.329
We formed five GoTrons.

215
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.505
And those GoTrons formed the GoGoTron.

216
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.871
Go, GoGoTron!

217
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.571
âª Take it away, boys! âª

218
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.405
I will never get sick of this!

219
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.149
If you were a giant monster at that time,

220
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.538
in our universe, you never had a chance.

221
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.071
âª A bit of pasta with some anime combined âª

222
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.260
âª 'Cause we're two genres, but each one is intertwined, yeah âª

223
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.720
Mine needs a weapon like a Yo-Yo.

224
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.980
And a Yo-Yo on the chest. Are you listening to me?

225
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.771
I-I need you to respect this partnership.

226
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.580
I kept Rick removed from the ugly stuff.

227
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.638
If you got in his way, I got you out of the way.

228
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.600
And that made more room to move up.

229
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.190
The head of my right arm.

230
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.140
Me? I ended up the left foot of the left foot...

231
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.438
I guess because our robot didn't have an asshole.

232
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.580
Well, it had one.

233
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.950
Bitch! When are you gonna stop breaking my balls?

234
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.120
- You win, okay? - We're not competing, Morty.

235
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.880
And there's your answer. I could move you up

236
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.600
if I could trust you to put family first.

237
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.370
H-how is that putting family first?

238
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.650
Show me all the blueprints! Show me all the blueprints!

239
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.060
I agree. That's an issue.

240
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.980
Big Fat Rick, his flask stays full

241
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.471
or your locker gets empty. Thanks.

242
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.240
I know it feels good when he likes you,

243
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.738
but that doesn't mean him liking you makes you good.

244
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.438
Solid babble, Morty... like a fortune cookie written by Borat.

245
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.820
Yeah, I'm not as smart as you.

246
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.179
That's why I know you know what I mean.

247
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.000
You mean, if I really loved my family,

248
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.460
I'd give control of it back to your jealous ass.

249
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.759
Green Ferret Four needs a wash, and we're out of detergent.

250
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.720
- I just bought a box. - And Grandpa snorted it

251
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.738
- because you make him feel fenced in. - Sum-Sum?

252
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.230
Get two boxes.

253
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.638
We evacuated one of the planets we saved,

254
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.138
and built a secret nightclub on it,

255
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.740
a place no enemies could find us...

256
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.900
unless you count my brother.

257
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.880
I didn't even have my own ferret anymore.

258
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.019
Summer made me something called

259
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.410
an "associate security chief"... whatever the hell that means.

260
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.200
Look at this guy. And look at this guy.

261
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.740
Look-look at this guy over here.

262
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.240
Oh, there she is! My Baby Princess!

263
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.568
Get up here. Stop the music.

264
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.660
This. Is. Our. Queef... O-our Queen.

265
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.260
She saved my life. She-she set me free.

266
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.120
We wouldn't have what we have without this crazy bitch.

267
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.780
And she's got a special announcement.

268
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.560
Summer, tell 'em wha-what we talked about.

269
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.805
Now? I don't think...

270
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.271
Okay, I'll do it. God damn.

271
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.240
The new job did have some perks...

272
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.440
like, I got to be around the night Summer realized

273
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.740
- she was in over her head. - Okay, okay, I've got 90 extra ferrets,

274
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.407
which means I need 10 more,

275
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.220
and then four of you get your own GoGoTron,

276
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.600
and 20% of you get a GoTron,

277
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.205
'cause we're all gonna have a fucking GoGoGoTron.

278
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.138
He's very excited. Um...

279
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.200
Oh-pah!

280
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.260
I hate my family.

281
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.838
You should. Get in.

282
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.640
How's it going with your grandpa's compulsiveness?

283
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.105
Is your sister still enabling it? Huh?

284
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.371
Who are you people?

285
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.871
Let's just say we're the rightful owners of these ferrets.

286
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.405
Then, why were they scattered, and buried across the universe?

287
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.420
We mean in a more general, cultural sense. Arrrgh!

288
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.620
What your grandpa did is called "appropriation."

289
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.420
Not cool! Hunnnnngh!

290
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.789
Look, Morty, we've been watching.

291
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.971
We know you're the one that knows what's best.

292
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.500
Work with us from the inside.

293
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.380
Help us take over this operation.

294
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.780
We're literally designed for it. Mm-hmmmmmm!

295
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.177
Nobody will know it was you.

296
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.538
Then, you can get back to what's important.

297
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.238
Are those Boob Bucks?

298
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.480
Legal tender at every kiosk and ride! Huuunh!

299
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.580
I can't.

300
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.371
Summer's treating me like shit, but she's still my sister.

301
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.780
That's really noble, Morty.

302
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.260
If you were in our family, your loyalty would be rewarded.

303
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.620
But you're not in our family,

304
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.589
- which means we can kill you. - Oh, yeah?

305
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.160
And sure enough,

306
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.680
just when I stuck my neck out for the family,

307
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.020
it got stomped on anyway.

308
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.038
- Dad! - Mom! Dad!

309
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.300
Hothead Rick, baby!

310
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.938
I set myself up for that!

311
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.019
- What the hell happened?! - Hothead Rick.

312
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.571
How did he get so close to us?

313
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.079
- Morty was supposed to be security! - Morty?

314
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.930
I-I-I stepped away, all right?

315
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.340
But-but not to let that happen!

316
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.140
Morty, we're not attractive strangers

317
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.580
next to you on a flight to Paris,

318
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.380
traveling alone to get over a breakup,

319
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.046
so this is no time to be coy!

320
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.271
- Oh... pah. - Lil' Ricky.

321
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.938
I'm all wrapped up, Summer.

322
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.660
Guys, I know you don't trust me,

323
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.046
but what have we become?

324
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.507
Why are we doing this anymore?

325
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.405
Because it's fun, you little rat.

326
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.877
Now go home, and play video games

327
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.999
while we clean up these bodies,

328
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.340
or your mother and I will hire people to break your knees!

329
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.760
This is $16,000 we got from the deep state

330
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.160
for stepping on that trailer park.

331
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.119
That should be enough for school lunch and home repairs.

332
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.470
- Now, I gotta turn my back on you. - No!

333
00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:48.219
With Morty out of the way,

334
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.300
things were looking up.

335
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.700
But looks aren't everything.

336
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.040
Hi, Summer.

337
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.220
Um, my cockpit's not getting Wi-Fi.

338
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.839
Dad, you know that's not what I do around here.

339
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.640
Oh, I'm not your dad. I'm a version of him.

340
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.000
This is my first day here,

341
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.160
and I-I'm not sure what you do around here.

342
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.105
- Then fuck off. - Oh, fuck you.

343
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.938
Excuse me? I want your ID.

344
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.440
Mom. Are you Mom?

345
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.200
Can you control your rookie Jerrys?

346
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.380
Sweetie, we're all a little overwhelmed.

347
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.300
Good point. You're not a war-time mom.

348
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.940
Why don't you find your version of Dad,

349
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.740
and take a break, take a holiday?

350
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.529
I don't have time to wait for your confirmation,

351
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.219
so let's just say, if you're here in 10 minutes,

352
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.850
I'll have you removed.

353
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.060
And then, the GoTrons make the GoTrons,

354
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.200
make the GoTrons, make the GoTrons.

355
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.800
Couple of snags, but I know how to speed things up.

356
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.119
Remember when we talked

357
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.600
about how the best thing we could do

358
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.800
for the family is to recruit outside the family?

359
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.020
Yes. Way ahead of you.

360
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.500
Summer, I want you to meet Kendra.

361
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.040
She's from a temp agency.

362
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.959
She's got an entire workforce ready to go,

363
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.960
and all of them have previous giant robot pilot experience.

364
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.871
So, we'll be ready to go ahead of schedule.

365
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.349
Well, I don't know about that, but...

366
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.038
Well, Kendra knows. So...

367
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.838
So...

368
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.000
You here to break my legs?

369
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.860
No. We're here to talk shit about your sister,

370
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.071
because she just fired us.

371
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.880
- You're kidding. - Arrogant little bitch.

372
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.140
- Should we clip her? - No. She's not worth doing time.

373
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.727
You wouldn't do time. You brought her into the world.

374
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.140
So, I can take her out.

375
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.289
You thought there was an actual law?

376
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.720
It's a joke mothers say.

377
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.880
What kind of fucked up world have you been living in?

378
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.760
Uh, one where your mother murdering you

379
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.960
isn't a comedic premise?

380
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.980
Guys, there's a little adjustment period,

381
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.739
but pretty soon, you're gonna to return to normal,

382
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.099
and you're not going to want to kill Summer.

383
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.379
You're not even gonna be mad at her.

384
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.657
Nah, fuck her. She's my enemy.

385
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.849
Should we kill ourselves, so we can get to hell before her,

386
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.880
- and hide near the entrance? - Uh. I like that.

387
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.480
Rick fired me.

388
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.300
- Oh, baby. - Oh, sweetie.

389
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.757
I'm sorry.

390
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.040
Are you okay, baby? What happened to us?

391
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.396
We lost our minds.

392
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.040
I did it. Morty was right.

393
00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.220
I got addicted to making Grandpa happy.

394
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.450
It's only because your grandpa

395
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.779
inflates the value of his happiness.

396
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.600
That's a good point. I mean, look at me.

397
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.800
I'm easy to make happy,

398
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.638
which is why nobody gives a shit if I am.

399
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.100
I appreciate it, but there's something else too.

400
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.396
I've been really sensitive about family lately

401
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.560
because of something I've been keeping secret.

402
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.480
Okay. Who's on the Supreme Court,

403
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.559
and what state do we live in?

404
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.099
It's been years since I've thought about this.

405
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.557
No, I'm not pregnant.

406
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.260
But as you guys recall, and as a lot of people keep bringing up,

407
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.400
Morty and I did accidentally create a giant incest baby,

408
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.305
which the government did launch into space.

409
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.440
And I'm not sure how to tell you this,

410
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.260
but it is still alive, and I have been in contact with it.

411
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.720
There were soldiers waiting for me outside school last month.

412
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.700
They took me to the Pentagon, and briefed me.

413
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.171
And from there, I was shuttled to a secret base on Mars.

414
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.260
They had captured him,

415
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.240
and wanted to see if he'd respond to me,

416
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.105
instinctively, being his mother.

417
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.340
And he sure did.

418
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.229
But what they didn't expect was that I'd respond to him.

419
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.679
I was supposed to help discipline him,

420
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.805
so they could turn him into the ultimate weapon.

421
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.638
Instead, I trained him to love, to believe in himself,

422
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.600
and finally, to escape.

423
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.340
The government doesn't want anyone to know it happened,

424
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.271
but it's only a matter of time before the story comes out.

425
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.780
And when it does, all we're going to have is each other.

426
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.500
And you guys are a couple, and Rick has Morty,

427
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.040
but I'm the odd one out.

428
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.120
So, I wanted to make sure we stuck together.

429
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.960
But instead, I drove us apart,

430
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.300
and Rick replaced me with an anime girl,

431
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.880
so all I've got is myself and my giant, tortured,

432
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.900
government-trained rogue incest monster baby

433
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.940
out there in space somewhere.

434
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.960
Oh, baby. What the fuck. And then, you have to wonder,

435
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.860
what else are they doing with our taxes?

436
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.580
Wait. Summer, what did you just say?

437
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.871
Morty, a lot.

438
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.520
He replaced you with an anime girl?

439
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.100
Big eyes? Plus signs for teeth?

440
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.338
Ends sentences with weird sounds that don't fit?

441
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.019
Yeah. That's going to be his whole crew now.

442
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.640
And they're about to run their first test on the GoGoGoTron.

443
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.200
Those people want to steal the robots.

444
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.160
Th-they're gonna kill Rick. He's all alone.

445
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.460
We-we-we've got to go save him.

446
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.550
Right. Or... you know, fuck him.

447
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.589
- I'm good with that. - Yeah, fuck him.

448
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.048
Guys, a great leader once told me

449
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.005
you get the family you get.

450
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.871
All right. It works. Now, we just got to find a giant monster.

451
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.807
My sensors have picked one up, Rick.

452
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.238
- Okay. Okay Lock onto its location. - Yeah, got it.

453
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.205
- Oh, it's you! - Huh?

454
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.240
What the hell is this?

455
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.680
Thanks for making the biggest robot ever, Rick.

456
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.846
We'll take it from here.

457
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.038
- You little assholes! - _

458
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.430
- You son of a bitch! - _

459
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.070
Lock a load, boys.

460
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.705
Say "hello" to my little me.

461
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.280
Give up, old man. The G3 is ours.

462
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.380
And last I checked,

463
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.400
your "family" wasn't coming to save you, hmm?

464
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.280
Go go goo goo.

465
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.930
Holy mother of mercy!

466
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.300
My God. It's beautiful.

467
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.705
Yeah! Family!

468
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.289
- Is that... - It's exactly what it looks like.

469
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.560
- Yes. - Congrats, man.

470
00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.589
I see the resemblance.

471
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.910
Form the Energy Sword!

472
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.360
Activate the goddamn sword!

473
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.138
Oh, man, the sword.

474
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.319
Maybe we didn't think this through.

475
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.539
They're not actually gonna attack a space baby, are they?

476
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.139
I never thought I'd be the one to say this,

477
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.271
but you need to watch more anime, Mom.

478
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.405
Whoa, easy now, Naruto.

479
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.020
Bahbah go bye-bye!

480
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.838
What the hell is wrong with you people?!

481
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.680
You just have an incest space monster

482
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.240
in your back pocket, huh?

483
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.305
Welcome to the Smith family.

484
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.260
Shit. Put that down, Naruto.

485
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.519
Your great-grandpa is in there.

486
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.620
What do you say? One last zipline?

487
00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.460
Incest space baby. Nicely done.

488
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.360
After that, things pretty much went back to normal...

489
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.638
some version of it, anyway.

490
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.660
Rick said GoTrons were lame little kid bullshit,

491
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.180
and we never talked about them again.

492
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.940
Except all those gigantic space bugs

493
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.500
were still runnin' loose, and there were no GoTrons left

494
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.771
to fight them.

495
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.871
Yeah, millions die every day.

496
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.240
But you want to know what they could never kill?

497
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.305
Family.

498
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.830
- Where's Jerry? - Help!

499
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.020
Help! I'm still out here!

500
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.368
Yep, nothing's more important than...

501
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.146
Hey! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa!

502
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.505
Ugh!

503
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.671
And just like that, I knew our goose was as cooked as...

504
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.910
Voiceovarians. Ugh.

505
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.500
âª Magic sights, exciting sounds âª

506
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.180
âª Come day or night, and feel around âª

507
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.671
âª This is the world for you âª

508
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.777
âª No matter where you've ever been âª

509
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:47.038
âª This is the place your life begiii-i-ins âª

510
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.800
âª Boob World âª

511
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.405
âª Boob World âª

512
00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.838
âª It's a world for you, but it's actually two âª

513
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.205
âª Boob Wo-o-orld âª

514
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.160
- Samansky, you're late! - Won't happen again, sir!

515
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.260
Bugs, look to your left. Now, look to your right.

516
00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.438
None of you are coming back. Not one.

517
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.780
In the entire history of this program,

518
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.338
not a single bug has returned.

519
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.580
All right. Bring it in! What are we?

520
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.400
- Normal-sized bugs! - What do we do?

521
00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.340
Travel through an interdimensional gateway

522
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.820
to a planet with tiny people!

523
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.477
- Why do we do it? - To spread the cure for AIDS!

524
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:21.960
Hey, Sarge, how do we know

525
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.660
if these little people can understand us?

526
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.738
I mean, do these even speak Buganese?

527
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.060
Funny, Palicki. That's why we say it very loud.

528
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.277
Guys, you'll still be the same civilized bug on their side.

529
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.880
It's not like interdimensional travel

530
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.680
strips us of our clothes, and makes us screaming monsters.

531
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.560
Or maybe it does. It's impossible to know.

532
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.920
Now, get out of here!

533
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.530
My clothes... where'd they go?

534
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.590
_

535
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.390
_

536
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.030
_

537
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.760
_

538
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.060
_

539
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.005
Did you get any of that?
