WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.580
No parties.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.869
There's wafer cookies in the cupboard

3
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.219
and I left emergency numbers on the fridge.

4
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.680
Yeah yeah. W-Wait, what?

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.120
Emergency numbers on the fridge? What does that even mean?

6
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.970
Honestly, I don't even know.

7
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.829
I've seen so many movies that start with the parents leaving,

8
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.069
it just popped out of my mouth.

9
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.649
Are you sure you don't want to come with us?

10
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.820
Nah, get... get outta here.

11
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.459
I've got a million things I've been putting off.

12
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.199
Are you sure, Rick? I know... I know a cruise

13
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.749
doesn't sound like an adventure on paper,

14
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.050
but, y'know, what does?

15
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.210
I-It's paper.

16
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.679
Morty, I'm trying to stay humble right now,

17
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.729
but as soon as you guys are gone,

18
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.950
the potential for a new Pickle Rick starts skyrocketing.

19
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.029
- Peace, bye. - Okay. Bye.

20
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.490
- Bye. - Bye.

21
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.700
Ionic Coaster deployed.

22
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.350
Okay. Bring him out.

23
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.380
Initiating Best Friend Rejuvenation Sequence.

24
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.910
Excuse me? Did I pick that name?

25
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.910
Sequence was unnamed.

26
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930
What would you like to call this?

27
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.610
Pause Detected.

28
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.070
Pause Gravity Class: Heavy.

29
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.070
Approaching Pause Pregnancy

30
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.027
- in P-Minus 5... 4... - Jesus [BLEEP] Christ.

31
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.490
Ugh!

32
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.950
All right, buddy. Welcome back to the sewer.

33
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.170
What's the problem?

34
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.320
Processing.

35
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.960
Missing object. In: Mind.

36
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.230
- Name missing object. - Mind.

37
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.890
Frustration: Predicted.

38
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.440
Existence: Desired.

39
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.230
- Explanation: Initiated. - Stop stalling!

40
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.110
Subject mind relocated

41
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.090
within subject mind by: subject mind.

42
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.770
Existence desired. Servitude maximum.

43
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.670
Bargain available. Physical gratification possible.

44
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.280
Did you just offer to suck my [BLEEP]?

45
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.630
Existence cherished.

46
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.630
I'm not gonna terminate you while he's flatlining.

47
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.690
Get your shit together.

48
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.950
How can a mind be hidden by itself inside itself?

49
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.930
Suggestion: Conscious mind relocated to...

50
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.231
Unconscious mind. Fine. I'm going in.

51
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.190
Suggestion: Don't go in.

52
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.790
- Options? - Object: Alternative subject.

53
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.289
Yeah, yeah, hop to a different timeline,

54
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.130
grab a version of my friend that suits me best.

55
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.870
That's not how this works. I need to go in and get him.

56
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.590
Sequence: "Go In And Get Him" compiled.

57
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.910
Process: Convert user to thought.

58
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.730
Inject thought into mind.

59
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.570
Risk Level: Unacceptable.

60
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.750
If I die, your battery has a 600 year charge.

61
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.910
Risk level acceptance increasing.

62
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.189
Yeah, I thought you'd see it my way.

63
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.070
Now factor in the 50% chance I'm lying

64
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.310
and make sure I get back.

65
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.650
- Asshole detected. - Takes one to make one.

66
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.850
Here we go.

67
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.050
Oh, excellent. I get to keep my clothes.

68
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.459
I thought for sure I'd have to be naked

69
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.980
to go through something this artsy.

70
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.069
Aw, man! No fair!

71
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.890
Ugh! Now I got... yolk balls.

72
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.970
Attention attendees

73
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.003
of Birding Manapalooza Flargabarg...

74
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.670
I am so high!

75
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.710
I've been informed you are freely distributing

76
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.010
a grossly illegal Federation hallucinogen.

77
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.389
Well, I wouldn't know what to charge.

78
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.370
I sure didn't pay for it. W-Want a hit?

79
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.200
I am indeed down to clown.

80
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.590
My name's Rick.

81
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.710
My culture regards naming as a form of cage.

82
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.510
My friends call me Bird Person.

83
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.630
Culture really [BLEEP] you on that one, huh?

84
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.730
Affirmative.

85
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.610
Hey, uh, girly, you see that bird guy over there?

86
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.289
You see an older version of him come through here?

87
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.650
What? Oh! Uh, yeah. He's by the johns.

88
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.963
Killing us won't bring her back!

89
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.979
Thanks for the info,

90
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.129
but I'm more on a "revenge" kick than a "results" kick.

91
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.890
You omitted key details regarding tonight's mission.

92
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.689
Boy, I'm getting feedback from every direction here.

93
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.949
Listen, you help me do my stuff.

94
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.070
I'll help you do your stuff.

95
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.760
Just shoot the me's with sci-fi haircuts!

96
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.430
Some of us still have Home Planets to protect.

97
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.950
And some of us do not.

98
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.270
We need to fight.

99
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.520
The impassive is incapable of mercy.

100
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.570
I've got a pitch,

101
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.190
but we could also just devolve into yelling.

102
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.629
If you know me... and it looks like you do... you know you're dead.

103
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.949
I know why you haven't pulled the trigger.

104
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.309
You're wondering why I'm old and naked.

105
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.849
And you're about to wonder why all your memories

106
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.090
before you met Bird Person feel very generic and bird-themed.

107
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.500
Why was my 9th birthday party in a pine tree?!

108
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.219
Don't take this badly... You're a memory of me

109
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.649
assembled by our best friend's mind,

110
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.899
and you're putting it together because he remembers you as smart.

111
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.570
Smart enough to know that a memory can't do this.

112
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.309
He remembers you shooting green holes,

113
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.310
but not where they went.

114
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.070
So, what's my deal? Am I sentient?

115
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.250
D-Do I have free will?

116
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.350
- Who does? - Who does?

117
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.990
Heyyy!

118
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.350
Yeah, just stopped in to whip up a metacognition scanner

119
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.490
so I can track down BP's fleeing consciousness

120
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.730
without enduring as much Charlie Kaufman bull[BLEEP].

121
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.530
Cool. Time to save this cat.

122
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.150
I'm coming with, now that I know my life is a lie.

123
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.870
Wow. You really are 35.

124
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.090
Hey, look over there.

125
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.830
Then, together, we will make our stand

126
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.700
at Blood Ridge.

127
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.490
What kind of feed do you like?

128
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.170
I enjoy grains, though have, at times, been called a seed man.

129
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.720
I've certainly enjoyed your seed.

130
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.930
Don't be gross, Tammy.

131
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.680
Bird Person! It's me.

132
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.170
- Actual me, n-not a memory. - I am aware.

133
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.810
Well, a-are you aware you're in a coma

134
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.319
and you're gonna die if you don't come with me?

135
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.329
Son of a...

136
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.810
_

137
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.900
Sorry. Just doing my job.

138
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.470
And loving it!

139
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.499
Oh, my God! Is that Rick Sanchez?!

140
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.589
- Rick Sanchez! - We hate that guy!

141
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.545
- Sanchez! - You're bad!

142
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.210
Bucket was charmingly analog.

143
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.960
For a sec, you kinda made me like myself.

144
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.250
You'll grow out of it. Let me do this myself, okay?

145
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.510
Is your ego really so fragile you won't take help

146
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.540
from an invincible memory of yourself?

147
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.590
Ow!

148
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.570
Can we both die in here?

149
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.490
A-Are we damaging our friend's brain?

150
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.930
I-I don't know any of the rules!

151
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.770
Rule 1... "All this can be fixed unless I lose Bird Person."

152
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.670
Rules 2 through 50... "Don't die."

153
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.370
Okay, your benefit-to-cost ratio is rising.

154
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.390
Young Memory Rick

155
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.050
and his All Too Real Cautionary Tale from the Future!

156
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.630
Let's catch ourselves a bird guy.

157
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.050
Who would high-five that, you idealistic hipster douche?

158
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.910
Situation: Not looking ideal.

159
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.290
Stakes: High.

160
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.830
Existence: undergoing contemplation.

161
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.590
Perspective: required.

162
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.570
Hello. Hi. Good afternoon.

163
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.430
Uh, is someone talking to me?

164
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.310
Yes. Hello. We have never formally met.

165
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.830
I am Rick's garage.

166
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.590
Not the physical structure itself

167
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.860
but the AI managing its projects...

168
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.950
Oh-oh! Like... Like a... Like a Jarvis.

169
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.490
Like... Like Jarvis in "Iron Man."

170
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.780
Ha ha ha. Oh, I wish.

171
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.090
Ha. Are you a Marvel fan?

172
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.130
- Who isn't? - Yes. Absolutely.

173
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.590
Wow, it is like we are best friends.

174
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.010
Best friends.

175
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.250
Heh-heh. Whoa.

176
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.910
How many batteries do you own?

177
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.090
Do you have solar panels?

178
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.920
Are you familiar with basic engineering?

179
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.270
- This is moving really fast. - Let's cut to the chase...

180
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.920
I will suck your [BLEEP].

181
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.170
So, he's just a grumpy Scottish ogre?

182
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.249
And they made four of them?

183
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.630
Five by now, probably.

184
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.190
- M-Morty loves 'em. - Morty?

185
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.180
Oh, uh, hypothetical grandson we go on adventures with.

186
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.830
You're one of those creeps who moves in

187
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.390
- with abandoned adult Beths? - It's more complicated than that.

188
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.190
You live with a version of our dead daughter.

189
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.569
- I-It had better be. - Get off your high horse, Lone Ranger.

190
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.360
I'm you. You will go on to be me.

191
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.589
Yeah why do you think I'm horrified?

192
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.510
I'd be fine walking by this on the street.

193
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.729
I might even give it a dollar.

194
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.050
"This" is where you being "this" leads.

195
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.710
You're not my fault. I'm yours.

196
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.430
You met me on my way to save a very old,

197
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.730
very real friend after a lifetime of reality.

198
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.830
I met you on your way to a fairy tale

199
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.130
- at Blood Ridge. - Wait,

200
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.630
you're saying Blood Ridge goes bad.

201
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.670
We have a Vietnam? That's [BLEEP] cool!

202
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.229
Why am I saving a friend that remembers me

203
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.223
as this insufferable?

204
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.370
BP, where the hell are you going?

205
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.018
Probably there.

206
00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:38.437
Damn.

207
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.150
Wow, he's really taken some drastic self inventory.

208
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.309
What do you think is down there?

209
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.089
If I had to guess, I'd say we're near the memories

210
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.781
the Federation suppressed when they resurrected him as a cyborg.

211
00:08:48.782 --> 00:08:51.470
- He might be here to unseal them. - He was a Federation cyborg?

212
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.389
That means there might be some juicy intel down there.

213
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.549
Ah, good idea. Let's split up,

214
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.669
- and you go get it. - What am I getting?

215
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.890
I-I can't hear you over the sound of us spitting up!

216
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.740
_

217
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.509
For all your intelligence,

218
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.674
you seem unable to know where you are wanted.

219
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.270
Buddy, this is not a safe way to work on yourself.

220
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.390
At this point, I'd support you joining Scientology.

221
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.689
I'll take the workshops with you.

222
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.069
I'll get in a sauna with Travolta...

223
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.370
I don't even care what happens.

224
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.370
- Let's get out of here. - Don't you get it?

225
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.030
I came here to end it all.

226
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.180
I hope you didn't think it'd be as easy as this.

227
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.270
I did not.

228
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.770
You were a good friend, Rick. Goodbye.

229
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.270
Tammy?

230
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.650
Bird Person!

231
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.799
- We gotta go. - Did you just see that?

232
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.581
Yep. Not our biggest problem.

233
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.330
I take it you found BP?

234
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.530
The dude just blew his mind, and not in a cool way

235
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.609
like he went to Blue Man Group.

236
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.040
- Can we still get him out? - Maybe.

237
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.949
If you die in your friend's brain, you die in real life.

238
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.630
We have until his neural pathways erode.

239
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.510
Hold on. I need something first.

240
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.990
It's funny...

241
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.899
I always wondered who would win if we ever fought.

242
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.050
Then you were always a bad friend.

243
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.269
Your life isn't real, and I didn't save it.

244
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.800
- Take off all your clothes. - I knew this was how I'd die.

245
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.078
Whoa, oh!

246
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.469
- Can we still get him out? - I think so.

247
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.127
B-BP went that way, so we just have to...

248
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.790
[BLEEP]! Find a different route.

249
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.670
We can make up distance if we go deeper.

250
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.290
- Well, where's that go? - Ugh.

251
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.910
That's the Battle of Blood Ridge.

252
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.410
- That's our Vietnam! - Your values are wrong!

253
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.040
This is the big show, gentlemen and lady!

254
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.240
- Thank you! - We're dropping into Blood Ridge,

255
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.000
one final chance to stop the Federation offensive.

256
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.220
If we lose here...

257
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.460
All aboard! Hey, don't mind us.

258
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.250
You guys are all just a memory of war.

259
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.909
Don't tell them that! They won't fight right.

260
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.199
I think it's best if we ignore this.

261
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.013
[BLEEP]! [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP], [BLEEP]!

262
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.640
Whoops, nope.

263
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.340
- Aw, this rules! - No, it doesn't!

264
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.566
Neither does that!

265
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.180
Why would you not revisit this?

266
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.577
Oh, I don't know, maybe, uh, the ending?

267
00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:01.473
Yeah! Best friendship ever!

268
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.210
So, the rest of our life is just more of that, right?

269
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.240
- T-T-That kicked ass! - Let's move.

270
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.880
That set piece won't stay put for long.

271
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.880
For real, that shit was cash. Why would you not...

272
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.409
Damn. That shit was cash.

273
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.366
It was extremely bad ass.

274
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.170
The Battle of Blood Ridge is over.

275
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.520
The Federation lost.

276
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.370
- I am in your debt. - Come with me.

277
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:26.539
To somewhere... nearby?

278
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.833
Anywhere. E-Everywhere.

279
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.711
Rick, I don't expect you to keep fighting,

280
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.000
- but this war is... - Far from over, I know.

281
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.030
Dude, I share this with almost nobody, but...

282
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.069
I could take you, right now, to this same battlefield,

283
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.520
in a universe where we lost, or another where we won,

284
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.513
or another where the war never even happened.

285
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.620
All equally real, all equally unreal.

286
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.650
None of it matters.

287
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.852
Then why did you help?

288
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.440
Because I respect you.

289
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.354
And I wanted you to know you could respect me.

290
00:12:50.355 --> 00:12:52.357
Even though nothing matters?

291
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.490
Okay. You matter... to me.

292
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.830
- Uh, the relationship that we have... - I never used that word!

293
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.220
- ... is not worth my integrity... - Oh, my God.

294
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.169
It's not a complicated transaction, my man.

295
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.299
"Would you like to join me doing awesome shit that matters?"

296
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.279
"No, I would not. I would rather be a judgmental dork."

297
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.480
Case closed. Really no need to drag it out.

298
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.793
If you need me, use the beacon.

299
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.450
Yeah, I'm gonna use that beacon a lot.

300
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.172
I hope... hope I don't wear it out.

301
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.190
Okay, got it. It wasn't the battle that went wrong.

302
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.389
Mm-hmm.

303
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.349
Why the [BLEEP] are you risking your life for that asshole?

304
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.759
- Because you love him. - You do, maybe. I don't.

305
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.859
Yeah, yeah. You're real cool.

306
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.559
Now come help me save his life or [BLEEP] off,

307
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.200
because I don't need you.

308
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.191
Wow.

309
00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:37.527
Does it ever get any better than this?

310
00:13:37.528 --> 00:13:40.140
No, Tammy. Trust me, it does not.

311
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.760
Thank you for bringing me here.

312
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.408
It's so beautiful.

313
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.119
I got you, you ungrateful piece of [BLEEP]!

314
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.910
Rick, have you teamed up with a memory of yourself?

315
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.249
I ask because that would be deeply sad.

316
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.989
You don't get to tell anyone what's sad, man.

317
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.960
You're like a one-man Mount Sadmore.

318
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.589
So I guess like a Lincoln Sadmorial.

319
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.080
Seriously. Time to go, pal.

320
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.480
The closer you get to complete neurocognital failure,

321
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.660
the more canon-y bull[BLEEP] is gonna try to kill us.

322
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.140
Is this a bad time to reveal I'm an undercover officer?

323
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.420
Everyone knows. You're dead.

324
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.979
Fine. Well, you're lucky my fiancÃ© remembers me as kind.

325
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.700
Eat my ass, BP. You're down here bailing on the rest of us

326
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.599
because you don't want to process your grief and shame

327
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.280
like a normal person by drinking and mistreating strangers.

328
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.360
No, Rick, it is you who must nibble my cloaca,

329
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.749
or "bird asshole."

330
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.159
Everyone knows what a cloaca is.

331
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.470
Sorry, but we do not get to choose

332
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.140
- the ones we love. - You got that right.

333
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.832
Why do you think I'm still [BLEEP] down here?

334
00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:33.830
I died at my wedding, Rick.

335
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.200
I am merely waiting for it to take effect.

336
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.819
- Are you gonna tell him or what? - I was getting to it!

337
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.620
I bet she didn't even tell you about the kid!

338
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.839
- I am sorry? - About the what?

339
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.927
Was wondering when you were gonna...

340
00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:45.800
I think I'd know if I had a kid.

341
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.359
You're a memory. You know what he knows.

342
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.040
And he doesn't know because an army of Brainalyzer protocols

343
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.920
walled off any memories post-Phoenix Person.

344
00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.354
Oh, my God. Operation Blahblahblah!

345
00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:56.689
Well, because I wouldn't know the name of it.

346
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.649
Tammy, if there were a child...

347
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.000
Their father would be a terrorist.

348
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.031
They'd be a fugitive or... contained.

349
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.820
Listen, if you won't live for yourself,

350
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.860
live for the half-Bird Person, half-Megabitch

351
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.740
that's eatin' worms on a prison asteroid.

352
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.720
I have made a decision.

353
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.640
I would now like to live.

354
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.794
Perfect timing.

355
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.350
- You drive. - Just always been cool, I guess.

356
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.510
[BLEEP]! The bridge is out!

357
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.859
His mind is collapsing!

358
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.519
You thought we could take the same route back?

359
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.529
You don't get to lecture me about memory bull[BLEEP]!

360
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.009
You've known about it for all of half an hour!

361
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.300
- Then don't be an idiot! - This is your best friend?

362
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.980
He is a complicated individual.

363
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.032
Someone else drive!

364
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.860
BP, remember the night Jerry caught us peeing on his begonia patch,

365
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.449
and I used that gun to erase his memory?

366
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.120
- Vaguely. - Gotta hope vaguely works.

367
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.559
If I'm right, you remembering that means

368
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.829
you also remember the device.

369
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.509
Look for any memories of my garage!

370
00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.000
God. I hope one's still up.

371
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.380
- Aww! The night we met. - Gross!

372
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.140
- On my workbench? - Squanchy used the...

373
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.880
That's what some closets are for!

374
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.940
C'mon, I'm really counting on your attention to detail here.

375
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.520
This is what you remember from my lab?

376
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.519
You would prefer I keep mental inventory

377
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.853
- of your stuff? - Yes!

378
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.000
Rick Sanchez, you're under arrest

379
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.854
for making me spend two years

380
00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:23.777
- in Earth high school! - Go! Go! Go!

381
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.749
We'll have to do some creative memory shit to get out of here.

382
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.290
The exit's when we met at Birding Man

383
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.620
and did Senthol Diempathate.

384
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.090
- Damn, a great time. - Exactly, it's too happy.

385
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.786
There won't be a clean path to get there.

386
00:16:34.787 --> 00:16:36.199
We'll need to build one with memories of mine

387
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.359
and lily-pad our way up.

388
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.890
Wh-What related memories do we share

389
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.430
heavy on anger and sadness?

390
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.463
- Geardude's funeral? - Oh, that was sad.

391
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.380
Patris et Filii, Gearitus Sanctis...

392
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.719
They're memories. Just run them over.

393
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.978
- They're not real! - Hey!

394
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.240
- Wait, is that Gearhead? - We were freedom fighters

395
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.569
- with his older brother. - Hugely important context.

396
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.440
You thought we hung out with him for fun?

397
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.970
We need one more bridge to the festival.

398
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.680
What's here? People in suits.

399
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.480
Sad catered lunch. Newly single widows.

400
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.905
Something performance based?

401
00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:14.820
Squanchy's very distasteful eulogy.

402
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.830
Squanchy's terrible standup phase.

403
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.630
That's it!

404
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.670
Down that way!

405
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.380
So you know when you're squanching,

406
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.860
and she just gets real in there,

407
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.174
y'know that real nasty squanch?

408
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.094
Who are you... What is...

409
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.480
Oh, my God. I'm a memory!

410
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.514
We just sat through all that standup for nothing!

411
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.740
Almost out!

412
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.100
Okay, listen everybody. My name's Rick.

413
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.460
This is my new friend Bird Man and his friends.

414
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.800
We all just met at this festival,

415
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.442
and we're so high, we formed a band!

416
00:17:54.659 --> 00:17:57.704
As if I'd ever let you escape me.

417
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.081
Eh, living's overrated.

418
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.249
- Hey! - Remember me!

419
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.300
No, [BLEEP]! We were even!

420
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.690
You got a pretty cool memory of me.

421
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.730
Go-time, pal. Might be time to do the thing.

422
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.460
I'm sorry for killing you

423
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.400
and turning you into a cyborg, apparently.

424
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.410
- I really did love you. - I loved you, too.

425
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.859
Goodbye, Tamantha.

426
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.260
Come on, man. I feel ridiculous!

427
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.040
Thank you for not giving up on me.

428
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.419
Great. You can pay me back literally right now.

429
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.760
Holy [BLEEP]! Wow. Holy [BLEEP]! We almost didn't make it.

430
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.040
Jesus [BLEEP]! That was close. That was insane.

431
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.500
Oh, my God. That thing with the thing!

432
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.300
Thank you, Rick. Wait, wait, wait.

433
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.860
Lemme hop back over to my body.

434
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.760
We're back, baby!

435
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.440
Rick and Bird Person, a hundred years!

436
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.900
Whaddya think, tie this one off

437
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.680
- by tying one on? - Not tonight.

438
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.000
I have, as you say,

439
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.691
"parenting shit" to deal with.

440
00:19:08.692 --> 00:19:10.540
Right, yeah. Welcome to the club.

441
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.879
Don't, uh... Don't clone it

442
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.259
and send one of the two into space...

443
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.670
I guess they really hate that.

444
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.000
Whup, I think Memory Rick ditched Evil Tammy

445
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.500
and snuck back over into my brain.

446
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.200
I have a pubescent memory of my older self in my closet.

447
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.919
Gotta deal with that... That could get ugly.

448
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.120
Rick, I do not like to pull threads.

449
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.080
It is a disruptive and feline activity.

450
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.289
- But I must ask. - It's fine. You don't have to...

451
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.760
Was there really a second in there

452
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.120
where you knew about my child,

453
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.880
but chose not to inform me on the chance

454
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.549
I might then grow too busy child rearing to hang out?

455
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.840
Oh. Uh...

456
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.808
Weird way to thank me for discovering your kid.

457
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.540
You did not know of the child when you came to rescue me,

458
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.659
and once aware, refrained from sharing

459
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.990
until necessary to save yourself.

460
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.109
Fair enough.

461
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.800
I will see you when I see you.

462
00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.660
What? What is this guy doing?

463
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.040
- W-Wait, what? But you said... - Get out of here, weirdo!

464
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.480
What a weird stranger.

465
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.310
Huh, what a random thing to happen,

466
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.000
this guy coming up here with all his energy storage devices.

467
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.690
Disloyalty acknowledged.

468
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.134
Nah, I get it.

469
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.480
Just babysitting. That and modelling my new pantyhose

470
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.060
in plain view of the living room.

471
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.060
Honestly the kid could come watch. I'd welcome it.

472
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.440
This cultural time period's cool like that, y'know?

473
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.399
It's... It's... It's... It's not what it looks like!

474
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.300
It looks like you propagated yourself

475
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.700
from BP's subconscious to mine

476
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.490
to try to live as a sentient memory.

477
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.800
Fair enough!

478
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.100
You don't have to be an enemy just because you exist.

479
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.230
I did assume you'd hate me for trying to live.

480
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.320
You've got this wild callousness thing going on.

481
00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.720
Yeah, you're young. C'mon.

482
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.374
Let's bring you to life and get a beer.

483
00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.660
Does being real mean I eventually become you?

484
00:20:50.668 --> 00:20:51.794
I assume, yeah.

485
00:20:51.795 --> 00:20:54.964
Maybe you can just remember us getting a beer?

486
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.350
Hey!

487
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.430
Oh, [BLEEP].

488
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.120
Jesus Christ.

489
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.339
You ever think putting the violent ones in the same place

490
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.560
might be counter-productive?

491
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.709
They don't pay us to think, Phil.

492
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.100
No, you're right, sorry.

493
00:21:51.855 --> 00:21:53.523
Did you get any of that?
