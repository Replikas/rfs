00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:06.840
Hello? Hello?

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.140
- Hello, Jerry. - Nana!

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.138
Are you ready to come to the light?

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.975
Uh, I'm not sure. Where's Pop Pop?

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.930
He's not coming out to meet you anymore

6
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.100
because honestly, Jerry, this is getting annoying.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.180
It's not my fault!

8
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.692
My father-in-law asked me to help him gather data and...

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.860
Agh! Not agaaaaaain!

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.770
Okay, run diagnostics.

11
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.659
Holy shit, this is consistent.

12
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.560
- This is real. - What have you done?

13
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.520
You've got my grandparents pissed at me.

14
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.340
They'll forgive you because...

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.700
they're zero-mass fields of consciousness

16
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.296
preserved by a-a paradimensional layer of infinite energy?

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420
Morty, there's kind of a heaven! Kind of!

18
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.100
I-I mean there definitely is for a neurotypical like your father.

19
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
His conscious connection to a localized cultural model of infinity

20
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.220
functions like a wick, sucking his little mind

21
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.989
straight towards a source of energy strong enough

22
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.559
to support collective projection.

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.919
Great, so there's a heaven.

24
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.800
Glad you could learn that by murdering me eight times.

25
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.273
He's got kind of a point, Rick.

26
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.640
If you want to get into heaven,

27
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.909
can't you just stop being an asshole?

28
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.660
First of all, I don't want to "get into" anywhere.

29
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.580
I want to tap this paradimension's energy.

30
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.110
Secondly, you wouldn't catch me dead

31
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.500
in Jerry's generic-ass 1980s concrete

32
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.577
and fog machine heaven.

33
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.912
Well, guess what? You aren't welcome there!

34
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.680
You raise a good point, Jerry, obviously by accident.

35
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.700
My intact consciousness is too atheistic

36
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.110
to get channelled to any afterlife worth robbing.

37
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.840
It's a paradox.

38
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.500
Unless...

39
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.009
Morty, pack your parka.

40
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.640
We're going to Norway.

41
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.820
Or I can augment your skin with subdermal heaters...

42
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.140
I'll pack a parka.

43
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.382
Infinite energy, Morty.

44
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.929
You don't even know how to appreciate that

45
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.635
because you've never been in energy debt.

46
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.095
Fuck you. I've been tired.

47
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.304
- Perfect! - _

48
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.720
I'm going to Valhalla, Morty!

49
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.930
Your grandpa's going to be the first Valhallanaut!

50
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.226
Feel the excitement!

51
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170
Getting back will be easy.

52
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.530
Once the machine turns on,

53
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.300
I'll have set up the other side of the relay.

54
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.150
Phoenix Protocol initiated.

55
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400
Just hit that big red button to pull me into this body.

56
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.820
But how are you getting there?

57
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.740
I-I refuse to kill you again.

58
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.460
I-I'm desensitized, Rick.

59
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.240
I took some kind of test in school,

60
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.699
a-and the counsellor had to call Homeland Security.

61
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.710
Not your problem, Morty.

62
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.580
I need to die in glorious battle against a mighty enemy.

63
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.860
That's why I got Bigfoot in this PokÃ© Ball.

64
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.293
Bigfoot is your enemy?

65
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.640
Well, I doubt he's a fan. I stuffed him into a ball.

66
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.320
I mess with him all the time.

67
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.758
These Vikings don't have real tight bylaws, Morty.

68
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.089
This is basically their equivalent

69
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.970
of Native American burial grounds.

70
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.279
Bigfoot's dumb enough to attack whatever's in front of him.

71
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.015
And all I gotta do is die.

72
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.184
What happens to Bigfoot... after?

73
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.050
Morty, Bigfoot is a "B" story.

74
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.340
The "A" story is he kills me and you hit the button.

75
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.710
- Got it? - Got it.

76
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.526
All right, let's do this!

77
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.090
Oh!

78
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.740
Oh, snap, I-I did it!

79
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.160
Valhalla, baby! I'm Dead Rick!

80
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.340
Oh, shit, I'm dead Rick.

81
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.580
Welcome to Valhalla, brother.

82
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.611
We thought all Vikings had perished.

83
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.300
Ah. Nope. I was... I was a straggler.

84
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.531
How's it work here again?

85
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.420
We fight! We die! We feast!

86
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.590
And then we fight again!

87
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.000
Ha-ha! Cheers, everybody, cheers!

88
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.730
So, is there a time window between battles

89
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.712
where a guy could go off and, I don't know, gather resources?

90
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.410
Yes, now you'll receive your Armour.

91
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.060
Knock, knock.

92
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.200
Oh, wow.

93
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.780
You're a new arrival. What do you require?

94
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.060
Honestly, I-I'd love to take most of your tools.

95
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.580
I'd planned on starting from scratch,

96
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.860
but you're, like, way past the Iron Age here,

97
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.080
saves me a lot of time.

98
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.560
I make only the finest for Valhalla.

99
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.857
Beautiful hammer.

100
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.027
So, in Valhalla, what happens when we get knocked out?

101
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.440
- Then we're just knocked out. - Cool.

102
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.020
Oh, wow, is that a thing Vikings love?

103
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.084
Oh, God, brutal.

104
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.320
Wait, what?

105
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.345
Bigfoot... do you have religion?

106
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.120
Y-Y-You understand me, don't you?

107
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.150
D-Does Rick do this to you all the time?

108
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.860
He messes with me, too.

109
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.941
Easy, there, big guy. Easy.

110
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.420
Oh, shit!

111
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.300
Look at this little one!

112
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.520
You must be made of piss and dragon balls

113
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.050
to reach Valhalla at your age!

114
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.000
Oh, yeah! Y-Yeah, man!

115
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.860
Dr-Dragon Balls all day.

116
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.840
H-Hey, h-have you guys seen an old skinny guy around here?

117
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.380
Of course!

118
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.800
But wait, where did that guy go?

119
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.359
He should have his Armour by now.

120
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.420
What in the mighty whale's wooden cock?

121
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.380
The old man! He's some kind of witch!

122
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.411
A friend of yours?

123
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.280
What? Why would I be friends with a witch?

124
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.380
I was just asking.

125
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.120
Well, that's really offensive, man!

126
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.820
What is this, Judgmenthalla?

127
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.660
I don't know until I ask, all right?

128
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.279
Somebody around here gonna make me some pants,

129
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.590
or do I have to call the feds on this place?

130
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.900
Surrender, witch!

131
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.320
Easy, guys. Th-This was all a test, and you passed.

132
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.250
- I'm actually Odin. - Odin?

133
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.720
Yep, Thor's father, Spider-Man's uncle, et cetera.

134
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.770
I came here to do like an "Undercover Boss" thing,

135
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.400
making sure Valhalla's running smooth,

136
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.220
which it is, and as your reward,

137
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.235
I'm assembling this majestic transdimensional energy relay,

138
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.740
which none of you should ever touch,

139
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.550
or it'll make your... goats...

140
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.740
have haemorrhoids, understood?

141
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.826
And you need nothing from us?

142
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.019
I'm only here for a few hours,

143
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.520
but since you're asking, I'd kill for a beer and a sandwich.

144
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.000
Beef, cheese, no onions...

145
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.919
- Is someone writing this down? - Ow, my balls, ow, my balls,

146
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.836
- ow, my balls! - Morty? Why are you here?

147
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.546
You are friends with the witch!

148
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.592
What the fuck, Morty! You're my ride home!

149
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.700
Bigfoot killed me!

150
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.050
He killed you, he killed me,

151
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.389
and he was going to kill your clone.

152
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.848
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, Morty, no!

153
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.960
I-I opened the cage.

154
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.500
Bigfoot was burying your body.

155
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.560
- He... He was mourning you! - He does that.

156
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.970
Morty, any big idiot can pretend to believe in the afterlife.

157
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.920
That's why we're dealing with these fucking guys.

158
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.440
They're just Norwegian Bigfoots.

159
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.480
Jesus Christ, run this cable over there.

160
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.529
We don't have much time.

161
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.920
Hull breach imminent.

162
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.680
Initiating survival protocol.

163
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.796
Aah!

164
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.496
We'll take it from here.

165
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.860
And who are you?

166
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.750
CIA? Interpol?

167
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.461
We work for the man upstairs.

168
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.883
Hello, Bigfoot. I'm-a the Pope.

169
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.580
I'm sure you don't know what that means.

170
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.740
Which is why I've been so eager to acquire you.

171
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.300
The Church, you see, has many enemies, but also many rules.

172
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.360
We can't kill.

173
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.360
We can't command a man to kill.

174
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.310
But you are not a man.

175
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.980
You are a thinking beast from outside God's domain,

176
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.572
which will make you the Vatican's greatest weapon.

177
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.325
Your holiness, he is wild. He can't be controlled.

178
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.610
Ah, but we know what he wants.

179
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.333
Yes, my child. Yes.

180
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.503
You will have your naked imbecile.

181
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.714
But first, you will work for me.

182
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.136
Morty! Heads up! Incoming wave.

183
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.800
Clear!

184
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.300
They're sending more every time.

185
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.149
It's fine. I'll upgrade the turret's rate of fire,

186
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.720
but I need to finish this relay.

187
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.579
You need to figure out how to get us back to life!

188
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.240
Without my infinite energy?

189
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.069
I-I don't think you're thinking this through, Morty.

190
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.499
I-If we manage to get home, we don't get another shot at this.

191
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.519
Y-You think the next time these idiots see a naked man

192
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.480
on the battlefield, they're gonna give him a beer?

193
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.690
So you'd rather stay dead until you win

194
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.290
than live as a loser?

195
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.084
Maybe you belong here with these idiots.

196
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.560
Yeah, I could probably teach them how to hit a red button!

197
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.710
I said I was sorry.

198
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.840
And I said keep killing them

199
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.550
while I finish the relay.

200
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.010
And I will get us back home. Okay?

201
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.887
Okay.

202
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.410
Oh. Oh, no.

203
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.550
Okay, I'm done here.

204
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.569
- You ready to get back to living? - Yeah, but how?

205
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.960
Morty, infinite energy means infinite energy.

206
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.189
All I have to do is pull a lever

207
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.880
to send us back home into new bodies.

208
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.969
Then voilÃ , no more need for crystals.

209
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.310
But the second we turn our back,

210
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.389
those guys are just going to trash this place.

211
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.725
Oh, Morty. Ye of little faith.

212
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.759
Do we even need to attack him?

213
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.410
I told you I was Odin, you faithless heretics!

214
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.490
And I'll keep blowing you up in this pit forever

215
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.240
unless you follow these commandments.

216
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.320
Spider-Man?

217
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.040
There's 10 of them,

218
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.500
but they basically revolve around

219
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.790
not going near the energy relay.

220
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.007
Is anybody going to go near the energy relay?

221
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.980
Okay. You have pleased me.

222
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.513
I'll get you, guys... some kind of a ladder.

223
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.920
Target is in sight.

224
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.480
Excellent. Release the bait.

225
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.100
I just love worshiping the devil with you guys.

226
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.420
Who are you?

227
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.620
Only the Pope wants to kill us, but he can't kill...

228
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.000
Yes. Very good.

229
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.844
But we can do even better.

230
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.180
You work-a for the Vatican!

231
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.640
Our enemies are your enemies!

232
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.980
_

233
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.860
Yes! Yes!

234
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.907
_

235
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.720
Here, my sweet. This will help you communicate.

236
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.590
I traded a Predator three muskets for it.

237
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.600
So it is their currency?

238
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.320
Give me what you promised.

239
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.382
Yes, child, you've earned it.

240
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.780
All right, Morty, wanna grab a mead for the road?

241
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.100
- Nah, I'm good. - Then here we go!

242
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.890
Man, I take back everything bad I said about clone vats.

243
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.140
There's a method to the madness, Morty.

244
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.900
And now... infinite energy, baby!

245
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.040
What the...

246
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.560
Someone's hacking into the Earth-bound side of my relay, Morty.

247
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.580
Pretty crazy,

248
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.519
whoever's doing this would have to be a spiritual leader

249
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.400
with limitless resources.

250
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.090
In fact, I guess there's only really one...

251
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.160
You're fucked.

252
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.120
- Fuck. - It is over.

253
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.040
My torment ends now.

254
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.970
What the hell?

255
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.392
Are you seriously working for the Pope?

256
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.300
The Pope saw my potential.

257
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.897
Prepare to be crushed by Bigfoot.

258
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.060
- Ha ha. - Don't worry, Morty.

259
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.580
I've got this under control.

260
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.880
Jesus Christ, Rick, just apologize.

261
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.390
You assumed Bigfoot was dumb,

262
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.320
- which was dumb of you. - You're right, Morty.

263
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.780
Underestimating people only gives them the high ground.

264
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.041
Admit why you bullied me.

265
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.794
Because I thought it was funny that you were stupid.

266
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.797
People are intelligent in different ways.

267
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.830
I know, I know.

268
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.840
I-I'm clearly stupid at knowing when other people are smart.

269
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.070
Listen, I know you can't tap your gauntlet,

270
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.970
but I'll take a guess at what you're saying.

271
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.380
You hate me because I tortured you to get what I want.

272
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.510
- Rick! - But I only used you to kill myself!

273
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.980
How many people have you killed for the Pope?

274
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.180
Help me stop him, and I'll make it right.

275
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.860
For starters, here.

276
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.760
Ow, that hurt. Wait a second.

277
00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.020
Yeah, hands-free.

278
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.340
- Also upgraded that voice. - Thank you.

279
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.170
In a world where time actually is money...

280
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.630
Ooh, I-I think I know this movie.

281
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.793
You guys can do this bit at the Vatican. Let's go.

282
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.000
Oh, hey, Bigfoot.

283
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.200
What you got back there, eh?

284
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.740
Rick and Morty.

285
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.810
Uh, dead. For Pope.

286
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.720
Aye, that's them.

287
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.260
All right, last thing, I just got to take a sharp stick

288
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.970
and stab them both.

289
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.395
That's just the rules.

290
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.021
Hyah!

291
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.910
Sorry, Morty, so much for the quiet way.

292
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.680
- I appreciate that we tried. - It's a fucked-up rule.

293
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.370
Poooooooooooooooope!

294
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.580
It's over, the Pope. We got you.

295
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.980
See, this is why religion sucks.

296
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.500
Infinite energy, and the Pope uses it

297
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.040
to levitate like Criss Angel.

298
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.120
All right, wow, not how I saw that going.

299
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.880
I guess getting killed by the energy

300
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.230
sent us up the conduit to its source.

301
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.740
- Hey, guys. - Oh, fuck.

302
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.030
No, no, just need some clothes and horses.

303
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.470
Maybe not for Bigfoot.

304
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.822
Unless he wants clothes?

305
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.710
Ah, excuse me, Lord Odin.

306
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.880
Is this a test?

307
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.123
Yup, yup. Uh, you passed!

308
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.050
Ewww, feet... so small.

309
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.300
Why is he in a clone of Summer?

310
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.090
Statistically speaking, she's the third most likely to die.

311
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.990
All right, let's kill that son of a bitch.

312
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.141
Hold on, I can see where this is going.

313
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.510
Poooooooooooope!

314
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.280
Aah!

315
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.900
- Wow. - I gotta admit, Morty.

316
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.109
I didn't really fight that time.

317
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.057
- I wanted to make sure this worked. - Handsome.

318
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.480
Yeah, you like that? Bigger feet!

319
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.220
Even gave your brain a little more lobe.

320
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.210
Thank you! Me love it.

321
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.240
- Me... - Dial it back.

322
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.000
You don't wanna come across like a Muppet.

323
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.400
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

324
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.650
Poooooooooope!

325
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.500
Maybe we just portal right up close to the guy

326
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.130
instead of doing the guards every time.

327
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.546
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

328
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.420
Maybe bigger chin?

329
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.989
Look at this. He's fucking giving notes.

330
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.800
Bigfoot, come on, w-we need you to put a little more fight in.

331
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.520
If need help, Bigfoot do know some guys.

332
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.027
Pope has... other monsters captive.

333
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.154
Man, you guys really don't quit.

334
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.614
I can do this all day.

335
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.430
Yeah, but these guys can do it...

336
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.500
All night!

337
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.140
Wow, big anticlimax!

338
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.780
Mummy, you look good!

339
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.217
This afterlife smells like beer.

340
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.380
I guess this is what infinite energy looks like.

341
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.120
Fuck. Really wish we had time

342
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.640
to unpack all of Frankenstein's parts making it here.

343
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.259
Bigfoot, take these guys up to the relay

344
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.420
and prepare for a siege.

345
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.890
What are you gonna do, Rick?

346
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.897
Listen, I'm not really your god,

347
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.316
just an old man who wanted to cheat your system.

348
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.000
Guys like me think we can run the joint

349
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.400
because everyone is so dumb.

350
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.820
But it's a dumb universe.

351
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.860
I work for you.

352
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.370
The customer is always right.

353
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.210
Give me 10 Viking minutes after we leave

354
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.161
and then pull the plug on that windmill we made over there.

355
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.497
And this isn't a trick?

356
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.040
Is your mother's pussy a trick?

357
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.210
- Hey! - Kick his ass!

358
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.250
Go, Morty, go!

359
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.500
Why the hell did you do that?!

360
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.000
The only way to end this is by turning off the power, Morty!

361
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.173
But we have to get home!

362
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.740
That's what these guys are for!

363
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.900
Monsters, hold the line!

364
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.120
Everyone but Bigfoot!

365
00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.513
Hoo-rah!

366
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.520
That wasn't them leaving, right?

367
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.849
No vay. That vould be cold-blooded.

368
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.980
Pooooooooope!

369
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.600
Who do you-a bring this time?

370
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.640
The Harlem Globetrotters?

371
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.113
That's actually a good pitch.

372
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.239
It's over for you, Pope!

373
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.491
Time to atone for your sins.

374
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.280
Bigfoot, you were God's greatest assassin.

375
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.380
Now look at you... hairless with normal feet.

376
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.416
Yes!

377
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.860
Rick, the energy relay's still up!

378
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.337
Shit, was really counting on those monsters to lose faster.

379
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.464
Huh?

380
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.480
That's more like it.

381
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.750
Pour one out for the Wolfman.

382
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.260
I don't understand.

383
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.340
You know what they say,

384
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.930
when God closes an infinite energy relay...

385
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.220
Nooooo!

386
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.760
God damn...

387
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.000
All right, I'm just gonna say it so nobody else has to say it.

388
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.780
- Popey Ball. There. - Okay.

389
00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.840
If I didn't say anything, someone was gonna be like,

390
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.180
"You missed Popey Ball. It was right there."

391
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.720
I thought about not using a PokÃ© Ball because of that,

392
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.040
and it's just the right tool for the right job.

393
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.820
W-What, am I supposed to not use it

394
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.300
and shoot the Pope in the head?

395
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.560
I was gonna say it.

396
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.966
Wait, w-why are we at the woods?

397
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.080
Time to go on home, big fella.

398
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.080
Oh. Uh, okay.

399
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.870
You're free. Just go!

400
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.098
You guys are being weird.

401
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.640
Stop making this so hard for us!

402
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.960
Go on. Why can't you go back where you came from?

403
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.180
Ow! You don't have to throw things at me to say goodbye.

404
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.450
Just go!

405
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.567
I'm not an animal anymore.

406
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.320
I-I was hoping I could... I could get a job and... Ow!

407
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.031
- Go on! Get! - Get out of here!

408
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.040
I'm going. I'm going, okay?

409
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.140
Ow! Stop throwing things!

410
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.161
- Ow! - Go!

411
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.860
- Okay, I'm leaving. - Get out of here!

412
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.247
- Okay. - Go on, get!

413
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.680
Wha... Wha?

414
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.750
Oh!

415
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.940
What kind of sick sons of bitches...

416
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.119
These things are trained to fight.

417
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.520
I don't want to hear it, Henderson.

418
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.720
Wh-What year is it?

419
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.932
Who's the Pope?

420
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.120
Shit if I know.

421
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.393
Let me check.

422
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.490
This guy, apparently.

423
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.483
Nooooo!
