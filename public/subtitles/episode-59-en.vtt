1
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.550
I... I can't hold them off, Rick! Th-There's too many!

2
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.638
Richard!

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.870
Your fortress is a salty waste of coral and clam.

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.892
Relinquish it at once!

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.560
Aah!

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.860
Submit, you continental cunt.

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.020
- Aah! - Got a better idea.

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.289
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

9
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.600
Aah!

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.110
Aah!

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.900
- Happy? - Of course I'm happy.

12
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.040
You're acting like you won,

13
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.650
but this is exactly what I wanted!

14
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.120
I am Mr. Nimbus!

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.360
Ugh, whatever.

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.950
- Come on, Morty. - Man, that was intense.

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.980
Yeah, nice work, buddy.

18
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.930
Sorry I had to blow up your bunker.

19
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.595
Not so fast, Sanchez.

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.690
It is I, Cookie Magneto.

21
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.940
What the fuck?

22
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.580
I'm... I'm not engaging this guy.

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.240
That's hardly up to you, Rick.

24
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.140
I'm sorry, do you control things that people agree are cookies?

25
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.700
- Yes. - Okay, but cookies aren't a substance.

26
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.119
They're more of a name we... we give to...

27
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.611
To the things I control.

28
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.400
Do you control cookie ingredients?

29
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.819
Because, y'know, t-that sounds dangerous.

30
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.330
Y'know, everything has sugar in it.

31
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.750
Fight me and find...

32
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.440
Aah!

33
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.290
- Jesus, Rick! - I'm sorry, Morty.

34
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.432
I know you're gonna say it's punching down, but I can't fight

35
00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:22.880
another one of these '90s-style goofball super villains.

36
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.930
I'm not the fucking Tick.

37
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.044
I'm... I'm exhausted.

38
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.940
Okay, but i-if you really have a lot of these guys gunning for you,

39
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.679
maybe you should look into what you're doing to...

40
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.530
Oh, don't start that crap, Morty.

41
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.100
I don't do anything for these dipshits to seek me out.

42
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.380
I am Mr. Calypso!

43
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.700
Face me, you ugly, drunk, ugly piece of shit.

44
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.730
Okay, I might look into it.

45
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.610
Why don't you have a seat?

46
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.100
'Cause this isn't a therapy session.

47
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.500
I-I'm just asking you what people in your racket say

48
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.830
about handling this particular situation.

49
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.420
First, we'd want you to define the situation.

50
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.140
I'm a walking target for a never-ending sea of angry nerds

51
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.179
that think getting in a fight with me is some kind of...

52
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.420
I don't know, platform?

53
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.640
I mean, look at this guy.

54
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.340
He shows up and calls me an "ugly drunk."

55
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.939
Because, of course, that's the angle of attack

56
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.170
that's gonna undo me, right?

57
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.290
You don't shoot Batman in his fucking Batman logo.

58
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.510
And you think locking this man in a chamber

59
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.670
and milking him of cosmic fluid will somehow resolve this?

60
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.010
I think it's the best I can do to profit from a situation

61
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.430
and maybe set an example.

62
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.380
But you've set this example many times

63
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.467
and it's not changing your situation.

64
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.379
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and now you're gonna tell me to ignore them.

65
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.012
But guess what? They want that too.

66
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.700
And why would they want to be ignored?

67
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.410
You really believe if I let a guy like this do whatever he wants,

68
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.920
he gets bored and vanishes?

69
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.813
Rick, would you be interested in proving me wrong?

70
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.810
- Yes! - Then show me data.

71
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.151
Ignore them for a week and see what happens.

72
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.986
You're on, bitch.

73
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.220
Is that man dead?

74
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.640
Is everything in here confidential?

75
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.520
- Everything but murder. - Then he's fine.

76
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.710
I mean, I-I think it's pretty big, you know?

77
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.250
Big step for the big cheese.

78
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.090
- Yeah, Dad, I'm impressed. - Can we not make it a big deal?

79
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.550
It's worth celebrating, Rick.

80
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.220
You accepted the concept of therapy

81
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.830
without turning yourself into a pickle or a housefly.

82
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.710
Jerry, for fuck's sake, that was a regular fly

83
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.990
in her office that day.

84
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.360
- What the hell? - Riiick!

85
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.270
How 'bout a little piss?

86
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.330
Rick, why is there a man shooting piss on our front lawn?

87
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.500
- I'm sure he'll tell you. - I am Pissmaster!

88
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.800
Here to flush the toilet that is Rick Sanchez.

89
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.650
He's spraying my lavender bush.

90
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.700
My bees need that lavender!

91
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.980
Remember five seconds ago

92
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.539
when you guys were stoked about me changing

93
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.250
because it made you feel superior?

94
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.430
Ooh, whole family's here. Who's that redhead?

95
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.630
Wouldn't mind spraying her with a golden shower.

96
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.790
Oh, my God, what?

97
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.120
- Hey! - Okay, that's it!

98
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.269
Jerry, please think about this.

99
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.599
If you fight this guy, I'm either an asshole for not helping

100
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.680
or an asshole for helping.

101
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.000
My daughter just got spoken of in porno terms,

102
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.530
and I'll respond how I choose!

103
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.559
- Wait, Dad, don't! - Honey!

104
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.890
Hey.

105
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.677
You want a piece of piss?

106
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.364
If that's your stupid rude way

107
00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:24.230
of saying I have to fight you, I will.

108
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.599
Take your shot, pussy.

109
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.690
Don't talk to me that way. Go away!

110
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.000
- Make me. - Go away!

111
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.773
Ow!

112
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.180
Careful, honey!

113
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.050
Just stay down.

114
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.030
- I... I don't even know you. - Yeah, you don't know me.

115
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.200
But I'm gonna know your whole ass, you son of a gun.

116
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.500
- Hey, none of that! - Break it up, guys!

117
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.400
Come on, you dirty motherfucker.

118
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.180
No! No, no, no, no no!

119
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.680
Stop! Aah!

120
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.100
Uncle! Mercy! Mercy!

121
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.860
Stop! I give up!

122
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.530
Apologize to my daughter.

123
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.130
For what?

124
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.140
- You know for what! - I'm sorry!

125
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.800
I'm sorry I sexualized you!

126
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.540
It came out wrong!

127
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.631
That's my dad. That's my fucking dad!

128
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.260
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

129
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.180
- Ow! - Oh, sorry.

130
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.290
Thank you, Rick.

131
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.840
Damn, hashtag #FlamingoDad is everywhere!

132
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.430
Buzzfeed made an odd numbered list

133
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.620
of other people's observations about you,

134
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.770
and you're getting a lot of hand clap emojis

135
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.110
on White Twitter's impression of Black Twitter.

136
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.600
Jezebel's offering a cash reward

137
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.300
for evidence that you're a bad person.

138
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.880
That is their highest honor!

139
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.530
So this is what it's like to trend.

140
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.390
Feels good. Feels right.

141
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.809
Just keep in mind, now a bunch more assholes

142
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.459
are gonna know they can get a rise out of you.

143
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.030
- Boooo! - Rick, let a dog have one day.

144
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.560
I'm letting! I'm letting!

145
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.797
Whoa. Are those orbs?

146
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.160
This is what I'm talking about.

147
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.250
Some asshole saw that fight and, believe it not,

148
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.300
they were jealous of Pissmaster.

149
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.200
I am Blagnar the Eternal.

150
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.650
We seek the earthling who beat up Pissmaster.

151
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.312
That's my dad, Jerry Smith!

152
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.330
Jerry Smith.

153
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.857
Our Galactic Orbship thirsts for justice

154
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.520
- and those who deliver it. - Wait, what?

155
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.880
Our great council would like to offer you this silver orb

156
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.198
and with it a place amongst us.

157
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.991
Whoa. It... It... It's sticky.

158
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.250
Yeah, that means it's found a pure heart it wants to bond with.

159
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.990
Y-You guys saw my son-in-law on the news,

160
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.160
now he gets a sticky orb.

161
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.100
What's the catch? We're not rubes.

162
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.040
Yeah, your power is well known in our jurisdiction, Rick Sanchez,

163
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.673
and it should come as no surprise that our orbs are unsticky for you.

164
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.370
Oh, no, first I get banned from the Nextdoor app,

165
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.390
now this.

166
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.870
I'd be honored to join your organization.

167
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.150
S-So what do I do? Rub the orb when I see crime?

168
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.016
Or... Or eat the orb like spinach?

169
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.710
The orb is raw power.

170
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.380
Trust your heart, Jerry.

171
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.231
It will know what to do.

172
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.330
Did you turn on the microwave?

173
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.180
No? Maybe? I... I was trying to fly. I...

174
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.327
- What? - I mean, come on, Rick.

175
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.496
Orbs and goblets, this is your thing.

176
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.914
Orbs and goblets.

177
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.180
I'm just saying, you're the orb guy in the family.

178
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.334
Can you please help me?

179
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.240
Jerry, I give you raw power, you'll end up miserable like me.

180
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.050
Trust me, I'm helping by not helping.

181
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.210
- Wow. - Seriously, Rick?

182
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.230
What the eff, Grandpa?

183
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.400
Some creep tried to pee on my tits and you did nothing.

184
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.240
Now you're gonna sit there and hold our dad back from being a hero?

185
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.016
- Are you seriously that petty? - Okay, you know what? Fine!

186
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.820
Here. Here's your goddamn suit.

187
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.650
I hard-wired the orb's infinite energy right into it.

188
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.240
This shooty-thing looks cool.

189
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.600
That "shooty thing" is a nuclear disruptor

190
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.080
- that can blow up planets. - Whoa.

191
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.240
- So tight. - Kinda hot.

192
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.300
Okay, show me, uh...

193
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.100
acts of evil happening around the galaxy.

194
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.980
Whoa, Space Hitlers?

195
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.410
"Space Hitlers are convening on Zeplar Prime."

196
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.750
My God, each one of them is their own type of Hitler.

197
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.579
- Yeah, th-that's a problem. - Oh, shit, do that one.

198
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.840
- Aw, you guys. - That's my parents.

199
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.800
Wow. Well, family,

200
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.780
looks like Jerry Smith has his first orb mission.

201
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.100
Lawn Flaming-Ho!

202
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.097
Just a reminder, you guys asked for this.

203
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.600
Soon, our legion of Hitlers will bring about a new galactic order.

204
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.540
- A Reich, if you will. - Riddle Hitler me this...

205
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.230
I'm sorry, are we just letting in all Hitlers now?

206
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.950
Auf wiedersehen, bad guys!

207
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.400
- Exterminate him! - Ow! Shit! Oh, Jesus.

208
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.782
One at a time!

209
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.880
Ah, oh, my God!

210
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.170
Uh, hope there weren't other people on that planet.

211
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.440
And there were no other people on the planet!

212
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.650
Only Hitlers!

213
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.020
Each one ready to start their own holocaust,

214
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.580
meaning an estimated 30 billion lives were saved

215
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.770
by a single blast.

216
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.620
And the galaxy owes it all to Jerry Smith.

217
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.270
Hashtag #FlamingoDad.

218
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.710
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

219
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.970
Up next... Oh, actually nothing.

220
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.261
I guess we're just gonna talk about Jerry Smith some more.

221
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.070
I dunno, therapy is starting to feel hopeless.

222
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.080
I've got so many issues!

223
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.110
Aah!

224
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.154
We need to talk.

225
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.520
Hey. No.

226
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.850
I will not speak with you

227
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.830
if you refuse to treat me and my patients with respect.

228
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.710
Oh, Lord. I was a fly!

229
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.260
So unburdened, so free of shame!

230
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.170
Welp, I'm officially cured!

231
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.200
Here. Here's your data.

232
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.880
Hard proof that God hates me.

233
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.040
I ignored a troll, and Jerry beat the guy's ass.

234
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.020
Now he's got this orb and he's using the power

235
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.330
which I gave him to annihilate planets of Hitlers,

236
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.270
and everyone's popping champagne.

237
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.660
Rick, you came here because you wanted things to change,

238
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.670
and they're changing.

239
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.685
It's working.

240
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.860
Oh, so if my bumbling moron of a son-in-law

241
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.480
beats up people, it's "working."

242
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.650
But if I do it, it's a cosmic abuse of power?

243
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.151
Rick, listen to yourself.

244
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.089
You're complaining about how you have to be careful

245
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.460
with your immense power

246
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.970
and that Hitlers are dead.

247
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.040
Everything you're describing is positive.

248
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.500
Oh, shit. Not reacting. That really is the kill move?

249
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.190
I don't know if you need to think about it in terms of murder,

250
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.080
but, yes, just stay the course.

251
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.450
Okay, good... good talk.

252
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.260
Well, what you're describing is therapy,

253
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.020
and if you'd like to keep receiving it,

254
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.850
start scheduling your visits with Judy up front.

255
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.820
Thank you, thank you, Flamingo Fam.

256
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.600
Uh, you know, when they asked me if I wanted to be the first human

257
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.400
to drive a Mitsubishi Space Lancer, I thought, "Well, I don't know.

258
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.040
I got this cool orb suit that goes really fast."

259
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.354
But you know what sold me?

260
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.019
The Council said I could pick my own bridge crew.

261
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.960
Morty, Summer, Beth,

262
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.300
- what do you say? - What?

263
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.480
- Are you serious? - Oh, shit, yeah, I love Mitsubishi!

264
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.299
- Me too! I-I've heard of them! - This is so exciting!

265
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.010
Oh, my God! This is so cool!

266
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.370
All right, gang, orbs away!

267
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.270
O me o' my, can it be?

268
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.660
A giant piece of shit I see?

269
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.000
I am Mr. Stringbean!

270
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.960
No one resists my rhyming scheme!

271
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.720
Hey, douchebag, why don't you chill out?

272
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.340
- Who's this asshole? - I am Doctor Buckles!

273
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.970
Here to tighten the belt on your opinions!

274
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.640
Oh, you wanna see the Bean get mean?

275
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.120
Aah!

276
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.830
I'll be damned. I'm out.

277
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.640
I'm out.

278
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.220
I'm... I'm out.

279
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.890
Oh, my God, this Piss Guy is getting wailed on.

280
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.540
Oh! Look at him, he tried to crawl under the car! What a loser.

281
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.600
- Hey, you watching the Pissmaster video? - Yeah.

282
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.430
He has to be the biggest piece of shit in the galaxy, right?

283
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.770
Oh-ho, without a doubt.

284
00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.650
Who could relate, being that much of a piece of shit?

285
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.180
God damn it.

286
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.570
Fuck, shit, come on, man.

287
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.440
Fuck, come on, where is it?

288
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.080
Shit, shit.

289
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.710
Ugh! Fuck!

290
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.720
Come on, Pissmaster, come on.

291
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.450
Aah!

292
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:57.980
Damn it.

293
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.911
It's me.

294
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.870
Please, please just open up. Dad?

295
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.820
Mom told me you weren't responding to her calls

296
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.510
and I'm worried, okay?

297
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.850
I know I said terrible things about you on my podcast.

298
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.632
It's just... I've been so frustrated with you.

299
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.379
Look, if you were to ever do something,

300
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.310
I'd never stop blaming myself.

301
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.620
Just, please. Please let me know you're okay.

302
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.960
God damn it.

303
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.100
I'm okay, honey. We're good.

304
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.854
I thought something happened to you.

305
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.000
I can tell you for sure... if anything happens to me,

306
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.460
it's 100% not on you.

307
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.030
It's my own choice.

308
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.430
You still sound like you're gonna do something bad.

309
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.115
Just promise you won't, okay?

310
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.720
- Okay, yeah. Promise. - Love you, Dad.

311
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.040
Fuck.

312
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.250
Well, this is it.

313
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.810
I'm killing myself because of Jerry Smith.

314
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.850
The Earth man. FlamingoDad.

315
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.300
Seeing them all cheer as I got my ass whipped

316
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.140
made me realize... people just wanna see me fail.

317
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.490
All I've ever wanted to do is prove them wrong.

318
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.900
Help!

319
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.213
Wait! Who are you?

320
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.590
Pissmaster.

321
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.650
M-Make, make sure you tell everybody Pissmaster saved you.

322
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.460
Those were heat-seeking pissiles by the way.

323
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.390
- Not just missiles. - Oh, ugh, okay.

324
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.130
âª Y'all ready for piss? âª

325
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.350
Yo! Pissmaster!

326
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.770
You saving that cat to make people forget you suck?

327
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.650
Nope, just saving it to save it.

328
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.070
Okay, we got nothing.

329
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.090
_

330
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.080
_

331
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.980
- âª Piss âª - _

332
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.880
- _ - âª Pee âª

333
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.680
- _ - âª Urine âª

334
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.350
- _ - âª Number one âª

335
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.410
- _ - âª Pee pee âª

336
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.940
âª Piss âª

337
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.080
- âª Pee âª - Look, it's Pissmaster!

338
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.310
Dr. Wong, what's up?

339
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.830
Rick, you're late for your session.

340
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.300
- Cancel it. Bill me. I'm good. - You're good?

341
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.049
Yeah, see, I put on the suit of my enemy

342
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.350
and I fucking love it.

343
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.530
Now I'm gonna make a giant bomb, plant it in a city,

344
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.870
and then have his suit auto-pilot the bomb into space.

345
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.894
Boom. Everyone will think Pissmaster sacrificed himself.

346
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.070
He dies a hero, I get a win I'd otherwise never get myself,

347
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.470
nice wet bow on top.

348
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.320
I'm tempted to second guess a lot of that,

349
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.850
but I think you might be nailing it.

350
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.490
- What? - If it's free and fun, do it.

351
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.573
It sounds healthy.

352
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.900
Oh, that wasn't my goal, but good to know.

353
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.490
Shit, gotta go.

354
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.880
No, exactly. And the slave planet thing,

355
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.820
I hear he broke their chains with pure urine, so...

356
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.280
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late,

357
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.540
- lot of traffic on the orbway. - Take a seat, Jerry.

358
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.650
We were just discussing Pissmaster's honorable rise.

359
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.110
I mean, who cares, right?

360
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.640
Uh, people are talking about him.

361
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.941
He's becoming likable. Good, even.

362
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.780
- But... he's Pissmaster. - People change, Jerry.

363
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.695
Everyone loves a comeback story.

364
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.660
All in favor of offering orbship

365
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.800
to Eugene Michael Piss, aka Pissmaster?

366
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.371
- Orb-yes. - All those opposed?

367
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.207
- Obviously orb-no. - The orbship has spoken.

368
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.110
You know what, Jerry? I think this is a good test for you.

369
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.560
If you can't let go of your pettiness enough to recruit Pissmaster,

370
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.230
maybe you don't deserve your orb.

371
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.350
And, Jerry... don't come back without him.

372
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.740
Absolute chaos!

373
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.450
No one knows who planted the bomb,

374
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.610
but one thing is clear:

375
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.080
Orphan Island, a city populated entirely by orphans,

376
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.090
now sits on the brink of doom.

377
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.800
The Orphan Island bomb squad is trying to dismantle it as we speak.

378
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.800
I can't stress enough,

379
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.740
I'm eight years old, I have no idea what I'm doing!

380
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.240
Look! It's Pissmaster!

381
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.050
Oh, no! There's no time to dismantle it!

382
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.750
Come on, it's not safe here.

383
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.230
- Whoa, oh, oh! - Whoo-hoo!

384
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.060
Pisspop? Pisspop? Pisspop?

385
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.930
- Pissmaster. - Jerry, what are you doing here?

386
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.070
Eugene Michael Piss,

387
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.910
by decree of the Andromeda strain,

388
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.030
our great council presents you with this orb,

389
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.052
which you have to take.

390
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.080
Fuck off, Jerry, I'm in the middle of something.

391
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.430
Excuse me? Hey, this is the greatest honor you could ever be given.

392
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.518
- I don't want it! - Well, you have to take it.

393
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.460
Jesus Christ, get the fuck out of here!

394
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.060
He's flying it into space!

395
00:17:46.085 --> 00:17:47.817
He's gonna sacrifice himself!

396
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.830
Get back here, you ungrateful shit!

397
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.240
What is your problem?! You're screwing up my hero death!

398
00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.120
- Good! - FlamingoDad wants us to blow up?!

399
00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.220
When did he become a shitheel?

400
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.790
Life comes at you fast.

401
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.000
- Jesus, Dad! People are filming! - Yeah, maybe dial it back?

402
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.010
Rick?

403
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.390
- PissSuit! Auto-pilot the payload! - Confirmed.

404
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.399
_

405
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.276
That's my fucking dad.

406
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.040
- Jerry?! - Dad?! Are you okay?

407
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.900
Your father is the fucking Pissmaster!

408
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.663
- Um... - Grandpa? What the hell?

409
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.710
Jerry, what is this?

410
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.600
People are saying you turned shitheel?

411
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.040
Well, apparently my father-in-law is Pissmaster,

412
00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.080
- so why don't you ask him? - What the...?

413
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.680
Rick Sanchez the Pissmaster?

414
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.636
- Okay, this is not a good look. - This family, man.

415
00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.400
Look, I don't know what kinda weird shit you two are pulling,

416
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.120
but it's completely unstickworthy.

417
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.540
- We're done here. - But I didn't know!

418
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.780
I-I'm a good guy. I... I made you all famous!

419
00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.450
I'm 1,000 years old.

420
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.100
You know how many "Flamingo Dads" I've seen?

421
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.340
Don't orb us.

422
00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.140
I don't get it. You... You were Pissmaster the whole time?

423
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.490
Obviously not, Jerry.

424
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.500
I put the suit on once Pissmaster kill...

425
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.413
Uh, when... when you made him...

426
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.084
Uh, yeah. I-I've always been Pissmaster.

427
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.300
But that would mean you let my dad beat you up

428
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.580
just so he could, like, feel more confident?

429
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.620
- Wow. - Damn, Rick.

430
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.310
- Yeah, that's amazing. - Hold on, Wh...

431
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.440
Everyone's just accepting this?

432
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.480
Wait. Wasn't Pissmaster an alien?

433
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.189
- He obviously avatar'd it. - Probably a robot.

434
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.640
But why? Why would Rick even prop me up like that?

435
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.140
Jesus, Jerry. Rick did something nice for once, okay?

436
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.230
He's obviously trying to change.

437
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.280
You are no longer worthy of Mitsubishi.

438
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.360
Proud of you, Dad.

439
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.890
Or should I say: Pissmaster.

440
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.230
Yeah, Grandpa, sorry I yelled at you.

441
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.599
And I guess I'm sorry for trying to stop you from killing yourself

442
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.610
with a nuclear bomb.

443
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.417
I just... really liked having an orb.

444
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.720
Eh. Don't sweat it, Jer.

445
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.040
Piss under the bridge.

446
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.950
Man, I guess the therapy worked, huh?

447
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.480
Opening up, doing all that just to make my dad feel good.

448
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.890
That's pretty great of you, Rick.

449
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.560
Yeah... that's right, Morty.

450
00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.190
That's right. Wait, Morty.

451
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.439
You have to promise not to tell anyone,

452
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.250
but your dad made Pissmaster kill himself.

453
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.440
- Oh, man, what?! - Yeah, I mean, I found him dead

454
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.560
and I... I put on his suit,

455
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.270
but look at this... he literally blames your dad.

456
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.960
Holy shit.

457
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.860
Wait, you kept the suicide note? That's so messed up!

458
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.880
I know, I mean, I had to tell someone, Morty.

459
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.599
- I couldn't just sit on that. - And you expect me to?

460
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.410
Morty, no! What are you doing?!

461
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.700
Aah!

462
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.480
What the hell?! He killed himself?

463
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.200
Jesus, Dad, you should've told us!

464
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.640
- Especially if Jerry murdered him! - Wait, don't say that,

465
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.619
- I... I didn't murder! - Hey, I... I thought it was pretty cool

466
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.659
- that I withheld that information. - But you didn't withhold it!

467
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.269
- You're walking around with the note! - Yeah, Grandpa,

468
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.529
you gotta, like, keep it in your heart as a great sacrifice.

469
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.539
That's the cool move.

470
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.240
I mean, how am I the bad guy? He sprayed piss on us!

471
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.553
- You... You all cheered me on! - Don't drag us into this.

472
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.919
- A man is dead, Dad. - Again, wasn't gonna say it,

473
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.339
- but I told you this would happen. - Get off your high horse.

474
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.959
- Dr. Wong would be so proud. - Go ahead and boo.

475
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.560
I was breathing piss, you think I care?

476
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.150
Is this what it's like to trend?

477
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.400
This is a nightmare!

478
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.620
I should've just let him pee on my daughter!

479
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.399
Ew! What the hell, Dad?

480
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.580
How about Jack Miller, aka CarJack?

481
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.339
- He lifted a car off a stranger. - Eh.

482
00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.350
- I guess. - Next.

483
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.040
- Orb-no. - We're fresh off a dad

484
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.060
and a piss guy.

485
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.320
Maybe we add someone that's already powerful?

486
00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.528
We have to be realistic about who we can get.

487
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.654
I have a pitch.

488
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.520
We're not gonna add Scarlett Johansson.

489
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.750
Next up: Mr. Nimbus, lord of the oceans.

490
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.871
Oh, I hear he controls the police.

491
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.900
- Wow. - The police?

492
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.940
- Orb-yes. - Ohhh. Guys, I already checked.

493
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.293
His reps say he's really busy right now.

494
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.559
- He just doesn't wanna do it. - Everyone says that.

495
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.920
Oh, and we're not busy?
