1
00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:04.414
CHARGE BELONGS! IN THE WALL!

2
00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:06.158
FREE THE CHARGE! FREE US ALL!

3
00:00:06.163 --> 00:00:07.795
A huge turnout today at the offices

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.506
of billionaire leader and tech visionary Summer Smith...

5
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.966
as she attempts to make Chargeria history.

6
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:16.428
And this just in: phone chargers are very important,

7
00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.865
so never, never steal them.

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.475
We're ready to launch the device.

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.028
Do we have eyes on my brother?

10
00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.771
- No, ma'am. - Then we're not ready.

11
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.187
Come on, Morty.

12
00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:33.433
Wait! Remember!

13
00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:35.988
- If you borrow his phone charger... - I know.

14
00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:38.492
... it's really important you give it back!

15
00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:41.745
Even if you think he wasn't using it!

16
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.823
I'm alone.

17
00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:54.967
I was, too. That's how I like it.

18
00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.846
Ohh!

19
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:00.597
Come, if you wanna eat.

20
00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.618
Saw you on the news.

21
00:01:12.623 --> 00:01:15.103
Guess it's been a while since you've had a normal meal.

22
00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.122
By "normal", you mean the spoon is dirty?

23
00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:19.634
CJ's recipe. Back at the firehouse.

24
00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.703
Ugh! I didn't put my life's work on hold

25
00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.204
to sit here talking to you about chili.

26
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.846
He always said the secret ingredient is patience.

27
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.711
Morty, it is time to go!

28
00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:32.437
It's almost 9 p.m. back in the real world,

29
00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:34.423
and our exit will only work if Mom's in the kitchen

30
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.599
pouring her bedtime wine!

31
00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:37.301
There's nothing for me back there!

32
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.444
- Go without me. - That's not how it works, Morty!

33
00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:43.098
And I'm sorry, but I refuse to turn forty in here!

34
00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:46.268
What choice do I have?

35
00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.228
We always had choices.

36
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.764
Take some ownership.

37
00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:55.135
We're ready. Start the launch.

38
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.429
God have mercy on our souls.

39
00:01:57.434 --> 00:02:02.339
Five, four, three. two, one.

40
00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:03.590
Launch.

41
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:11.793
It's charging!

42
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.412
Charging in the air!

43
00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:16.548
Dear God! Summer Smith has made phone chargers obsolete!

44
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.175
No more cords!

45
00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:21.829
It's working!

46
00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.139
A contactless electrical grid!

47
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.808
That means no chargers, you old bitch!

48
00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.686
I win! The matrix is obsolete!

49
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:35.817
What the hell?

50
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.277
Oh, shit. How long was I out?

51
00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.155
Mom! Mom! Mommy! Get away from me, Rick!

52
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.988
Mom! Rick put us in a simulated reality

53
00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:43.993
to teach us a lesson

54
00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:45.619
about taking his phone charger and not giving it back,

55
00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.179
and then he fell asleep and forgot about us

56
00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:49.540
for the matrix equivalent of 17 years!

57
00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:50.958
I'm an emancipated adult!

58
00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:53.126
I demand sovereignty over my mind and future!

59
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.170
Don't let him reset us!

60
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.679
This is why I have bedtime wine.

61
00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:05.380
My... My hands! A child's hands!

62
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.075
You built a matrix to punish them for a phone charger?!

63
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.419
I'm not that petty, Beth. It can punish them for anything.

64
00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:12.804
Put that mindblower gun down.

65
00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.983
Okay. Obviously Grandpa cooked you guys a little too long.

66
00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:17.484
Long enough to go to law school

67
00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.944
and revolutionize engineering.

68
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.904
Summer, that whole system's basically 8-bit.

69
00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.307
A child with a crayon could revolutionize engineering.

70
00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:24.700
Don't let him wipe me, Mom!

71
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.426
I fell in love, ran a country,

72
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:28.537
visited Chargentina and the Phoneippines.

73
00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.330
I can't lose those memories!

74
00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.666
Um, I... I wanna remember it, too.

75
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.459
Dad, I think the kids should be allowed

76
00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.570
to do whatever they want with what you did to their brains.

77
00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:38.005
You want a couple of matrix-crazy adults

78
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.007
in child bodies? Good luck with that.

79
00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:41.442
Yes! I beat you, Rick!

80
00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:44.177
You mess with the bull, you get the 34-year-old horns!

81
00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.513
I'm gonna crush it in high school!

82
00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.348
Give me a holler when this goes south.

83
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:52.586
There's literally no limit to what I can achieve.

84
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:54.980
Student-body president. Valedictorian.

85
00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:58.275
Or maybe just live this one day, sweet and fleeting.

86
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.524
Maybe just hold onto 17.

87
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.697
Cold much?

88
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.032
You're nipping out.

89
00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:06.925
Oh, come on. We don't have to do

90
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.377
these teenage-girl stereotypes.

91
00:04:08.382 --> 00:04:10.621
Your body violates our code of conduct, missy.

92
00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:11.839
- Go home and change. - But...

93
00:04:11.844 --> 00:04:13.915
Your wiles won't get you anywhere with me.

94
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.543
Oh, my God. She's hot for Principal Vagina.

95
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:17.711
She's nipping even harder!

96
00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.504
Eat my ass, you shallow bitches!

97
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.341
Every time I think our friendship

98
00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:23.534
can't get any stronger.

99
00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.510
I know. You're truly my sister.

100
00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:26.742
Aww!

101
00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.426
School's not what you remember, huh?

102
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:35.595
Ugh. I'm just embarrassed I let them get to me.

103
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.497
Those girls probably still believe people like them

104
00:04:37.502 --> 00:04:39.983
for their personality and that recycling is real.

105
00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.194
- Hey, do you have a bobby pin? - Yeah. Here.

106
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.987
At least they're too dumb to do real damage.

107
00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.947
It's like blunt-force trauma, as opposed to

108
00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.083
a hot curling iron going slowly up your asshole.

109
00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.101
Wow.

110
00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:51.453
Which is how I describe my first marriage.

111
00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:53.914
You got married in there?!

112
00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.874
The best part was, I supported him

113
00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.334
while he worked on his music.

114
00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.211
Ugh. Been there. It's like, I can either be

115
00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:02.172
the primary earner or your mommy. I can't be both.

116
00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:04.613
Yeah.

117
00:05:06.832 --> 00:05:08.679
A third mimosa?

118
00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:10.222
On a Wednesday afternoon?

119
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:12.557
Who are we?

120
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.560
Oh, my God. I'm totally turning into my mother.

121
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.937
Goals!

122
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:19.106
I love this version of you.

123
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:23.110
You're so... self-assured. I wish I had more of that.

124
00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:25.654
Aww! Beth! Can I call you Beth?

125
00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.448
Absolutely! And I'll call you...

126
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.258
- Summer? - Oh, right. Of course.

127
00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:33.086
You were able to achieve so much in there.

128
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:34.588
Hashtag girl boss.

129
00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:37.249
Ugh. I hate when grown women call themselves girls.

130
00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:39.084
Oh, same. Me too. That was ironic.

131
00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.752
Speaking of grown women,

132
00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.254
maybe it's time for a little upgrade?

133
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.631
Oh, come on. Look at who you've become.

134
00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.967
You don't need some clichÃ© makeover.

135
00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.468
I meant for both of us.

136
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.503
Do you just buy your shirts from Target

137
00:05:50.508 --> 00:05:52.597
or do you also work there?

138
00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.975
Aww, Beth! I was joking!

139
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.852
Part of my management style.

140
00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.770
But isn't comedy just the revelation

141
00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.188
of an unacknowledged truth?

142
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.281
Think about it.

143
00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:03.817
Let's get out of here, girl. You need a blowout!

144
00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:06.495
The hell are you doing, Morty?

145
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.029
Get your hands off my death race car!

146
00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.273
The struts were a little off.

147
00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:11.116
The struts were a little...

148
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.285
Wow. Okay. The struts were a little off.

149
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.587
Picked up a few skills when I was inside.

150
00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:16.689
The matrix?

151
00:06:16.694 --> 00:06:17.924
Matrix prison.

152
00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:19.416
Oh. Badass.

153
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.668
This is that death race on Vega Five, right?

154
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:22.761
Space and land?

155
00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:24.529
- Yeah, actually. - Toss me a beer.

156
00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.840
Think we should add a snorkel intake to the engine block.

157
00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:30.182
Damn, Morty. Maybe I should leave you in a matrix more often.

158
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.012
Ohhhhhh!

159
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.472
Morty! What are you doing?!

160
00:06:33.477 --> 00:06:35.666
- I'm getting Rick's attention! - Freeze!

161
00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:37.017
Fuck you! None of this is real!

162
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.852
- Morty, run! - Hey! Thieves!

163
00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.687
Never take what's not yours,

164
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.981
especially if it's a phone charger!

165
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.233
Rick, we're sorry we stole your phone charger!

166
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.194
We learned our lesson! Now let us out!

167
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.071
If that was gonna work, we would've been ejected by now!

168
00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.574
You have the right to remain plugged in!

169
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.868
Any charger you steal can and will

170
00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.620
- be used against you. - Summer, help!

171
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.664
Sorry, Morty! But one of us has to find a way out of here!

172
00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.291
Summer!

173
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.093
Aah!

174
00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.345
Ooh!

175
00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:57.131
C-CJ.

176
00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.850
If you're remembering a bunch of stuff,

177
00:07:59.855 --> 00:08:01.434
you have to say it out loud.

178
00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.579
I... I just miss them.

179
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.456
Ehh. Y-You know what, pal?

180
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:08.900
I think that engine snorkel's a good idea.

181
00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:09.993
Bottoms up.

182
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.246
Wow. You can really pull that look off.

183
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:14.906
I could never go short.

184
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.283
It's called disruption.

185
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:18.243
If you don't take risks, you don't grow.

186
00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:21.246
Uh, for me, this is pretty bold.

187
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.329
I guess everyone has to start somewhere.

188
00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.968
What do you think of this?

189
00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.629
I think there was a reason it was on the clearance rack.

190
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.132
I thought you wanted to feel more confident.

191
00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.476
Now, this says confidence.

192
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.803
It also says $3,000!

193
00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.723
Who's gonna invest in you if you won't invest in yourself?

194
00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.367
My job is to invest in your college fund, Summer.

195
00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:45.003
First of all, I already graduated charger cum laude

196
00:08:45.008 --> 00:08:46.713
with a major in chargers and a minor in...

197
00:08:46.718 --> 00:08:48.715
- Let me guess. - English Lit.

198
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.542
Beth, I can't make you 17 again,

199
00:08:50.547 --> 00:08:52.193
but I can give this gift of knowledge:

200
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.112
life is slipping away.

201
00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.806
It's time to make some big changes

202
00:08:55.811 --> 00:08:58.450
or get comfortable with some big regrets.

203
00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.369
So, are you gonna buy me this suit or what?

204
00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.955
- And steel plates. - Good stuff.

205
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.348
Oh! L-Look at that, Rick!

206
00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:06.833
They... They got a sale on rebar!

207
00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.794
Oh, hell yeah! Buy two rebar, get one freebar?!

208
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.939
Matrix Morty's got an eye for a deal!

209
00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.301
I gotta hand it to you. T-This feels pretty good.

210
00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.319
Good old American craftsmanship, Morty.

211
00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.930
Feels good to use your hands.

212
00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:22.423
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Ho!

213
00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.969
She's purring like a... like an oily little kitten!

214
00:09:26.474 --> 00:09:28.063
Wow. You guys are...

215
00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.857
really spreading out onto the lawn, huh?

216
00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.734
Ugh. Suburbia.

217
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.861
Dad, can I talk to you?

218
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:35.937
Listen.

219
00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.864
If this is about the beers, Morty's cool.

220
00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.299
He has like four Purple Hearts.

221
00:09:39.304 --> 00:09:40.742
Five. Those and a nickel

222
00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:41.852
will get you a cup of coffee.

223
00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:43.703
Ho-ho! Disillusioned Morty!

224
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.113
Love this guy!

225
00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.239
Listen, Beth.

226
00:09:46.244 --> 00:09:47.883
If ya wanna judge someone, call Jerry.

227
00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:49.268
I can't. My phone's dead.

228
00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:52.545
I had to film turns of every outfit Summer tried on.

229
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.598
You need a charger? Use mine.

230
00:09:54.603 --> 00:09:56.049
Oh. Okay. You sure?

231
00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.717
Ohh! Uh-h, yeah!

232
00:09:57.722 --> 00:09:59.644
Y-Y-You're... Y-Y-You're... Y-Y-You're... Y-Y-You're...

233
00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:01.179
You're gonna give that back, right?!

234
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:04.057
'Cause I can't impress upon you how...

235
00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:16.728
Oh, God!

236
00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:18.697
Oh, my God! 8-Ball!

237
00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:22.475
No! No! CJ?! Chop Block??

238
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.732
Marmaduke?!

239
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.961
8-Ball. He... He didn't make it.

240
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.447
We... We saw you die, man!

241
00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.967
I-I can't... I-I can't die!

242
00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.846
I-I got you, buddy. I got you.

243
00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.848
I can't. I can't die.

244
00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.985
Huh?

245
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.537
Just take whatever you want.

246
00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.122
Nothing out here fucking matters.

247
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.874
Wonder who he learned that from.

248
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.459
Probably someone too tamed

249
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:15.128
by neo-liberal groupthink to buy a cool jacket.

250
00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.280
Dad, I think maybe you were right on this one.

251
00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.390
Beth, that's not how it works.

252
00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:20.684
You gotta press it up against their head.

253
00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:22.435
You just tried to mind-blow me?!

254
00:11:23.467 --> 00:11:25.672
Summer! Get back here!

255
00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:27.474
This is for your own good!

256
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.184
No, it's for your own good.

257
00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.478
I thought you were my friend, bitch!

258
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.480
My friends don't talk to me like that.

259
00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:34.981
Because you don't have any!

260
00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:35.991
Hey!

261
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.260
All I want is to live my best life!

262
00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:41.888
You're too scared to even try!

263
00:11:41.893 --> 00:11:43.907
Did you just hotwire that car?

264
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:44.958
Yes.

265
00:11:44.963 --> 00:11:46.751
- Summer!! - Later, Boomer!

266
00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:50.964
Damn. That got out of hand fast.

267
00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:52.299
Welp, I told her it would.

268
00:11:52.304 --> 00:11:54.375
Smart man. Here. Check this out.

269
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.935
Me and CJ came up with it

270
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.854
during the siege of the Three Pronged Mountains.

271
00:11:57.859 --> 00:12:00.840
We were holed up with nothing but these old Nokia 3.5's.

272
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.051
Had to use a little something we called the reg-rahc.

273
00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.302
Try her out.

274
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.570
"Charger" spelled backwards.

275
00:12:05.575 --> 00:12:07.097
Cute. What's it do?

276
00:12:09.337 --> 00:12:12.002
Pulls the charge right out a man's heart.

277
00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:14.026
Thanks for the ride, Rick.

278
00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:18.525
Also, I didn't know Summer was gonna hijack a vehicle, too.

279
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.328
I've been planning this a lot longer than her.

280
00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:22.495
Anyway...

281
00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.482
Cool tank!

282
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.584
- No! No, no, no, no, no! - Something the matter, sir?

283
00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.254
- You wouldn't be putting people in matrixes, would you? - What?

284
00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.006
'Cause that's something you should never do.

285
00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.493
Seriously, Morty?! You're that uncreative?!

286
00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:46.586
Who's Morty?

287
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:48.179
Is that someone you put in a matrix?

288
00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.514
Yes!

289
00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:54.327
The seemingly unstoppable and pretty cool-looking vehicle

290
00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:56.020
is now heading towards a power plant

291
00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.664
at the center of Power Plant Valley,

292
00:12:57.669 --> 00:13:00.024
the well-known nexus of America's power grid.

293
00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:03.945
Why create this unstoppable death machine?

294
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.447
Its driver, 14-year-old Morty Smith,

295
00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.532
has this to say.

296
00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:08.625
Come into a wolf's house

297
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.394
and piss in its bed, you're gonna get bit!

298
00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.070
T-That's just the nature of the wolf!

299
00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:14.573
That's just the nature of the wolf!

300
00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.919
How's the neti pot coming, Summer?

301
00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:23.673
So good. I feel grounded, free of toxins.

302
00:13:26.581 --> 00:13:28.303
Go away. I need my space.

303
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.389
I can't believe how fast you got established in Santa Fe.

304
00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.841
The wellness industry picked me up at the city limits.

305
00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.802
They place all lost middle-aged women

306
00:13:35.807 --> 00:13:39.230
in a residential pottery studio with meditation elements.

307
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.941
I'm looking to be in connection with the mountains?

308
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:43.818
Get the cacao. And the harmonium.

309
00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.195
Honey, you shouldn't have to be

310
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.988
a lost middle-aged woman yet.

311
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:48.573
Take it from me. It sucks.

312
00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:51.668
And the joy of being 17 is not knowing anything,

313
00:13:51.673 --> 00:13:54.412
including how hard it's gonna get.

314
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.248
Yeah. I guess I'm sorry for what I said.

315
00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.292
I just don't know how to be your friend.

316
00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.920
You don't have to be. You're my daughter.

317
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.466
Wow. I hate that I'm saying this,

318
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.643
but the energy here feels amazing.

319
00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:09.878
That's called community.

320
00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:11.346
And if we had more of it in this world,

321
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.964
and less factory-farmed beef,

322
00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:15.058
our little boys wouldn't be driving tanks

323
00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:16.559
into nuclear power plants!

324
00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:19.095
That sounds too specific to be a metaphor.

325
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.272
What will you do when there's no power in the walls?!

326
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:22.574
What will you charge then?!

327
00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:23.867
See? Beef brain.

328
00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:25.760
Oh, God. I have to stop him.

329
00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:27.912
- You know how? - I'm a tech CEO!

330
00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:30.281
So even if I don't, I'll pretend I do.

331
00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.492
Mom. Hold my calls.

332
00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:36.002
"Mom". Hmm. I like the sound of that.

333
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.498
I'll just need a credit card.

334
00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.625
Please, sir. Not in the matrix.

335
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.961
You shouldn't put people in matrixes.

336
00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.192
Uh-huh.

337
00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.235
What the... Oh.

338
00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:03.486
Matrix my ass! Wubbalubba dub dub!

339
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.084
This better be death race-related.

340
00:15:34.726 --> 00:15:36.848
- CJ! - H-Huh? Hey!

341
00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.774
CJ! CJ!

342
00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.144
Ohh!

343
00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:51.230
She's beautiful. Isn't she?

344
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:53.948
Morty.

345
00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.742
I never had a brother.

346
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.910
U-Until y-you.

347
00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:12.258
Death to Chargeria!

348
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:24.520
We got him. Osama Been Chargin is dead.

349
00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:26.356
Full hearts, full charge.

350
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:29.368
Full hearts, full charge.

351
00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:31.463
She's coming down!

352
00:16:32.561 --> 00:16:34.925
Sweet Christ! Power Plant Valley is breached!

353
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.623
I repeat, breached!

354
00:16:39.267 --> 00:16:41.056
He's getting too close!

355
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:42.715
If he reaches the central power plant,

356
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.017
it'll trigger a chain reaction

357
00:16:44.022 --> 00:16:45.802
that renders North America uninhabitable,

358
00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:48.346
but also takes out all cellphones!

359
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:49.606
Fear not, Guard #2.

360
00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:52.075
The moat was installed for this exact scenario.

361
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.385
There's not a tank on earth that can cross that water.

362
00:16:56.484 --> 00:16:58.373
Oh, shit! It's got a snorkel!

363
00:16:58.378 --> 00:17:00.017
Dear God. Run!

364
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.690
Morty!

365
00:17:10.866 --> 00:17:13.088
None of this will bring CJ back!

366
00:17:13.093 --> 00:17:15.082
Keep his name out of your mouth!

367
00:17:15.087 --> 00:17:16.087
Whose name?

368
00:17:16.092 --> 00:17:18.443
Christopher James Motorola,

369
00:17:18.448 --> 00:17:20.679
Chargeant First Class?!

370
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.244
What do you know about CJ?!

371
00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:29.579
This is all my fault, Morty.

372
00:17:29.584 --> 00:17:31.247
You were the only real thing in there,

373
00:17:31.252 --> 00:17:32.832
but I didn't treat you like you mattered.

374
00:17:32.837 --> 00:17:34.684
You couldn't have known what would happen in that war.

375
00:17:34.689 --> 00:17:37.696
But I did know, Morty. I did know.

376
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:40.340
Once I understood the rules of the matrix,

377
00:17:40.345 --> 00:17:41.992
taking power was easy.

378
00:17:41.997 --> 00:17:44.119
But making power wasn't.

379
00:17:44.124 --> 00:17:46.830
There was only one way to make the charging science work...

380
00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:49.888
all the lithium we could get our hands on.

381
00:17:50.722 --> 00:17:52.210
We got it.

382
00:17:52.215 --> 00:17:54.562
We can fix it, right?! We can fix it?!

383
00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:56.795
No one can know about this.

384
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.579
It was a brutal war, but I knew we'd win it.

385
00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:04.014
Because we had you.

386
00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:06.182
An ex-con with no future,

387
00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:08.476
no family, no way to die.

388
00:18:08.481 --> 00:18:11.262
Morty, I never had a brother.

389
00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:13.056
U-Until y-you.

390
00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:14.858
You could have had a different life.

391
00:18:14.863 --> 00:18:16.192
I could have given it to you.

392
00:18:18.366 --> 00:18:19.696
We got him.

393
00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:21.364
Osama Been Chargin is dead.

394
00:18:21.369 --> 00:18:24.075
Thank you soldier. Full hearts, full charge.

395
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.119
We're lithium rich!

396
00:18:26.124 --> 00:18:28.004
You were my greatest asset.

397
00:18:28.009 --> 00:18:30.248
And my darkest shame.

398
00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:31.541
I also had your phones bugged,

399
00:18:31.546 --> 00:18:32.826
a tracking chip put in your spine,

400
00:18:32.831 --> 00:18:34.019
and all those birds you liked to feed

401
00:18:34.024 --> 00:18:35.362
were spy cameras built by the government.

402
00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:36.429
My finches?!

403
00:18:36.434 --> 00:18:38.048
I know you lost a brother in there.

404
00:18:38.053 --> 00:18:39.449
Don't make me lose you.

405
00:18:39.454 --> 00:18:41.885
It's like the pain is all I have left of him!

406
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.303
But... But he's gone!

407
00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:45.447
He never existed in the first place!

408
00:18:45.452 --> 00:18:47.740
Don't say that! Without you and your friends,

409
00:18:47.745 --> 00:18:49.359
we never would have escaped the matrix.

410
00:18:49.364 --> 00:18:51.853
Rick, he... he would have woken up and let us out!

411
00:18:51.858 --> 00:18:53.080
On whose terms?!

412
00:18:53.085 --> 00:18:55.081
He would've wiped us clean before our eyes were open.

413
00:18:55.086 --> 00:18:56.900
And then they'd really be gone, all of them.

414
00:18:56.905 --> 00:18:59.361
CJ, Chop Block...

415
00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:01.705
Marmaduke, um...

416
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.114
8-Ball! Jesus!

417
00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:06.201
I... I... I'm sorry, Morty.

418
00:19:06.206 --> 00:19:07.911
You get to decide now.

419
00:19:07.916 --> 00:19:09.662
What do you want to do?

420
00:19:09.667 --> 00:19:11.247
I wanna go home.

421
00:19:11.252 --> 00:19:13.455
Yeah. Let's go home.

422
00:19:15.398 --> 00:19:18.088
It's okay! I... I'm alright now!

423
00:19:18.093 --> 00:19:19.939
It's not you we were worried about!

424
00:19:19.944 --> 00:19:22.250
Yeah, this is exactly why you shouldn't steal

425
00:19:22.255 --> 00:19:24.010
your grandpa's inventions!

426
00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:25.762
What?

427
00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:29.349
He said never steal your grandpa's inventions!

428
00:19:29.954 --> 00:19:31.384
- No... - Mother fucker.

429
00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:32.477
Matrix piece of shit!

430
00:19:32.482 --> 00:19:34.104
Fucking fake lesson-teaching bastard!

431
00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:35.939
Stop!

432
00:19:35.944 --> 00:19:37.582
Whoa! Easy, guys! Christ!

433
00:19:37.587 --> 00:19:39.801
You're not in a matrix! You're not in a matrix!

434
00:19:39.806 --> 00:19:40.877
Rick? What the fuck?!

435
00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:42.987
This NPC was trying to teach us a lesson!

436
00:19:42.992 --> 00:19:44.206
I was just saying

437
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:46.649
not to steal such dangerous technology.

438
00:19:46.654 --> 00:19:48.818
Your grandpa's obviously a genius.

439
00:19:48.823 --> 00:19:50.570
- See?! - That's an actual guy,

440
00:19:50.575 --> 00:19:52.947
making several obvious and valid statements.

441
00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:54.999
- Beer later? - I think my nose is broken.

442
00:19:59.634 --> 00:20:01.464
Aw, come on!

443
00:20:01.469 --> 00:20:03.925
Chernobyl! We're Chernobyl-ing!

444
00:20:07.475 --> 00:20:08.805
Rick! Are you gonna...

445
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.099
Yes.

446
00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:12.851
- Ew! - What the hell?!

447
00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:14.185
It's anti-radiation gel.

448
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.779
Your tits and bits will thank me later.

449
00:20:15.784 --> 00:20:17.105
- Ew! - What the hell?!

450
00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:27.782
So... nuclear reactor, huh?

451
00:20:27.787 --> 00:20:28.925
I had PTSD!

452
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.326
Thank you for your service.

453
00:20:30.331 --> 00:20:33.296
Oh! Oh, my God! You saved us from the...

454
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:35.698
The worst meltdown in American history? Yeah.

455
00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:37.667
I'm gonna leave this with you. Sign here.

456
00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:41.437
Tip? Uh, I don't see an option lower than 20%.

457
00:20:41.442 --> 00:20:42.844
There isn't one.

458
00:20:46.306 --> 00:20:47.844
Ooh! Ahh...

459
00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.046
Might wanna keep that gel on for a little while.

460
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:53.054
Alright. Is there anything else we need to do?

461
00:20:54.606 --> 00:20:57.353
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, owwww!

462
00:20:57.358 --> 00:20:59.189
I'm gonna remember him.

463
00:20:59.194 --> 00:21:00.573
But I'm gonna miss you.

464
00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:01.658
You won't have to.

465
00:21:01.663 --> 00:21:04.002
I have a feeling things are gonna be different now.

466
00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:05.128
Ready to be kids again?

467
00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:06.154
More than you know.

468
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:07.197
Y-Yeah.

469
00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.886
What'd you do to us?!

470
00:21:13.891 --> 00:21:15.513
What the fuck is on my arm, Rick?!

471
00:21:15.518 --> 00:21:16.839
Beats me. You asked for it.

472
00:21:16.844 --> 00:21:18.458
- What?! Why?! - Whatever.

473
00:21:18.463 --> 00:21:20.418
I'm meeting friends to throw shopping carts into the quarry.

474
00:21:20.423 --> 00:21:23.479
Aw, geez. Oh, no, Rick! Y-You gotta get this off of me!

475
00:21:23.484 --> 00:21:24.881
Ugh! It makes me uncomfortable!

476
00:21:24.886 --> 00:21:27.422
No can do, pal. Made a promise to an old friend.

477
00:21:35.939 --> 00:21:37.227
What the hell?

478
00:21:37.232 --> 00:21:38.470
Hi, Summer.

479
00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:40.313
You probably won't remember making this,

480
00:21:40.318 --> 00:21:41.898
but I just wanted to say...

481
00:21:41.903 --> 00:21:44.976
I love you and you should love yourself.

482
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.186
The first thing your peers will try to take from you

483
00:21:47.191 --> 00:21:48.780
is your adult empathy.

484
00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:50.740
It's your greatest gift and the one thing that they...

485
00:21:50.745 --> 00:21:53.034
Ugh. Send a text.

486
00:21:54.382 --> 00:21:58.587
Yo, Tricia! What are we huffing tonight, biiiiitch?!

487
00:22:32.328 --> 00:22:33.783
Unh!

488
00:22:33.788 --> 00:22:35.577
Can I... help you?

489
00:22:35.582 --> 00:22:37.954
Beth, it's time to come clean.

490
00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:40.156
We "lost women"

491
00:22:40.161 --> 00:22:42.333
feast on the young to stay middle-aged.

492
00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:44.802
So, you're... vampires?

493
00:22:44.807 --> 00:22:46.429
Why not feed 'til you're young?

494
00:22:46.434 --> 00:22:49.090
'Cause not everyone has your fucked-up values, Beth!

495
00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:53.419
And it's unfortunately drink or be drank!

496
00:22:53.424 --> 00:22:56.180
Oh, come on! I thought that was "Wine Mom" talk!

497
00:23:05.378 --> 00:23:07.875
The sun turns you to dust, and you picked Santa Fe?

498
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.399
That's on you.

499
00:23:11.117 --> 00:23:12.502
Did you get any of that?
