1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.059
What kind of parents drag their kids away

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.839
for the entire week of spring break?

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.699
I'm missing Mike Triscuit's drug party.

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.357
Look at this. He's already watching

5
00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:09.497
"Euphoria" to pregame.

6
00:00:09.498 --> 00:00:12.049
Pregame. Game. Video game.

7
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.039
Yes, yes, drugs and video games. Poor babies.

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.967
What you need is to level up with a bong rip of nature.

9
00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:20.605
Trust me, this is good for you.

10
00:00:20.606 --> 00:00:22.707
Can someone just kill me?

11
00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.151
Grandpa Rick, you can kill anything.

12
00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:26.747
No, he can't, Summer. We're roughing it.

13
00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:28.377
And that means no sci-fi bull-[BLEEP].

14
00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:30.019
- Isn't that right, Rick? - Uh-huh.

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.669
Rick, was that a sci-fi phone call?

16
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.799
Shut up, Jerry.

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.849
Damn it, I didn't think she had this number.

18
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.239
Why are you building a Faraday box to block out the signal?

19
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.864
Oh, my God, Grandpa's ghosting someone.

20
00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:45.819
I'm not ghosting. Hey! Give it back, Summer!

21
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.439
"Rick. Please answer me. I'm pregnant"?!

22
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.590
Oh, my God, Grandpa, you [BLEEP] boi.

23
00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:53.305
I'm not a [BLEEP] boi, Summer!

24
00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:54.723
- There's no way those kids are mine. - Wow.

25
00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:57.377
At least we know why Rick actually came on the trip...

26
00:00:57.378 --> 00:01:00.059
- to avoid his [BLEEP]-guy problems. - Why would this person lie?

27
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.247
I don't know, honey. She's addicted to what the Rick did.

28
00:01:02.248 --> 00:01:03.699
You know, it's... it's... it's a tale as old

29
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.191
as my huge dynamite penis.

30
00:01:05.192 --> 00:01:06.200
Can we turn the radio on?

31
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.957
I am not letting you abandon those kids

32
00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.821
- like you abandoned me. - Oh, my God!

33
00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:12.017
We're going to see this baby mama right now!

34
00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:13.289
What, like, literally now?

35
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.700
Yes, now! That's an order.

36
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.439
Aah!

37
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.860
No!

38
00:01:20.598 --> 00:01:22.967
This is exactly what I was talking about!

39
00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:25.238
Rick, I hope you realize the tubing permit

40
00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:26.599
was non-refundable!

41
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.319
Relax, Jerry, we'll be in and out in a minute,

42
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.430
and then you can get right back to your dumb vacation

43
00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:32.120
with a family that doesn't need you.

44
00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:35.379
Kind of expected someone to defend me,

45
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.640
but, sure, okay.

46
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.439
Hello, Gaia. Hold on.

47
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.287
Let me just adjust my Seismic-to-English translator.

48
00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:44.814
Rick. You came.

49
00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:47.317
- W-Where is she? - You're looking at her.

50
00:01:47.318 --> 00:01:48.987
I-I-I-I don't understand.

51
00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:50.320
Isn't it obvious, Morty?

52
00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:51.979
I [BLEEP] a planet.

53
00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:26.189
So, what, you just go around knocking up planets now?

54
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.267
I-I-Is that what you do when I'm at school?

55
00:02:28.268 --> 00:02:30.127
I'm a scientist, Morty. I try things.

56
00:02:30.128 --> 00:02:32.537
Sex with a living planet? Big step for mankind.

57
00:02:32.538 --> 00:02:35.137
Yeah, we finally broke the deadbeat dad barrier.

58
00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:37.243
- Ah, where the magic happened. - Gross.

59
00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:39.160
Hey, uh, Gaia, baby,

60
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.288
Big Daddy Rick is here. What's the problem?

61
00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.239
Children. Birth cycle. Now.

62
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.740
Okay, gettin' right into it.

63
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.959
- I am! I am! - Jesus Christ!

64
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.464
- I am! - I am!

65
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.709
I am!

66
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.779
Dad, do something! Make it stop!

67
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.899
You think I know how to stop this?

68
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.340
I thought she was gonna shit an egg.

69
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.389
Cool vacation, guys.

70
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.069
So happy I got to see the human geyser

71
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.832
instead of micro-dosing with my friends.

72
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.367
More coming. Kids. Need father.

73
00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:07.698
Yeah, um, Baby Quakes, how big is your orbit again?

74
00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.667
I mean, not to say you get around, but, um...

75
00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:11.005
Are you kidding me? Look at them!

76
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:12.119
They look just like you.

77
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.979
Yeah, and snakes look like dildos, Beth.

78
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.154
- What's your point? - They do?

79
00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:16.807
The fact is even if they were mine,

80
00:03:16.808 --> 00:03:19.339
which they're not, the best parent is evolution.

81
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.739
They'll probably develop harder skin

82
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.247
or maybe even webbed arms.

83
00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.387
Man, that'd be cool, huh? Flying squirrel people?

84
00:03:24.388 --> 00:03:26.629
Yeah, Dad, that approach worked out great for me.

85
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.167
Beth, I know it looks bad, but trust me.

86
00:03:28.168 --> 00:03:29.794
This is life in the galaxy, okay?

87
00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:30.820
It's totally normal.

88
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.258
Fine. You won't do something, I will.

89
00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.260
Welp, there goes the surprise!

90
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.999
I was gonna have us jump on the trampoline

91
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.359
- after we caught our first fish. - I am!

92
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.722
What? You're stupid.

93
00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:42.141
- I am! - I am! I am!

94
00:03:42.142 --> 00:03:44.767
- Beth, that's not gonna help. - Uh, I hate to agree with Rick,

95
00:03:44.768 --> 00:03:46.115
but shouldn't we just let this be?

96
00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:47.354
We're supposed to be on vacation.

97
00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:48.479
You're unemployed, Jerry!

98
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.189
Every day is a vacation for you.

99
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.979
- Okay, ouch. - You guys do whatever you want.

100
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.485
I'm staying here and fixing this.

101
00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:55.111
- I am! - I am!

102
00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:56.489
Goddamn it, Beth, if you're gonna do it,

103
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.640
at least do it right.

104
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.223
Gaia, baby, gonna need a little raw iron and steam.

105
00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:02.368
Whatever you need, baby.

106
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.727
- So much for camping. - Nope.

107
00:04:11.728 --> 00:04:13.179
We are going camping.

108
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.319
There's trees over there.

109
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.215
- We're on solid ground. - Mom!

110
00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:17.676
Summer, Morty, go camp with your father.

111
00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:19.385
- Ohh, son of a bitch. - Son of a bitch.

112
00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:20.553
- I am! - I am!

113
00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:23.808
- I am! - Welp, welcome to lack of abandonment.

114
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.747
Dad, can we please go back

115
00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:28.287
and hang out with Grandpa's clay people?

116
00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:31.009
Why? Because they might have a Sega Dreamcast?

117
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.314
Why is it so hard for you two to let nature in?

118
00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:34.719
Because this sucks ass.

119
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.070
Camping is just being homeless without the change.

120
00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:39.257
Well, that attitude is exactly why we're out here.

121
00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:41.327
You guys wouldn't last two seconds on your own.

122
00:04:41.328 --> 00:04:43.097
You're only happy when you're penned in

123
00:04:43.098 --> 00:04:46.496
and drugged up like some kind of chicken or lemur. Hey!

124
00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:48.259
I told you kids no phones!

125
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.620
There's not even any service.

126
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.376
Just... Just let us be happy for a minute.

127
00:04:51.377 --> 00:04:53.419
You know, maybe if you two stopped whining

128
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.277
and let your old man take the reins,

129
00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:58.347
you might actually learn something.

130
00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:00.608
Here. Take a bite of this tasty treat.

131
00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:03.179
Oh, you think this s'more makes you special?

132
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.279
What? Because someone said,

133
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.417
"good job," to you once when you were 10?

134
00:05:06.418 --> 00:05:08.933
That's actually really sad, Dad. Let's be real.

135
00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.423
You've been high-roading us non-stop,

136
00:05:10.424 --> 00:05:11.449
forcing us to do nothing

137
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.359
in the middle of [BLEEP] nowhere because it's the only way

138
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.937
you're gonna level the playing field, isn't it?

139
00:05:14.938 --> 00:05:17.027
Because if you move the bar so low,

140
00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:19.362
you might actually seem like you're worth a [BLEEP].

141
00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:21.628
Huh.

142
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.850
I'm gonna go take a walk.

143
00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:31.040
Jesus Christ, you really need to stop hanging out with Rick.

144
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:37.716
Okay, so, if we divert the Lawyer Pipeline here,

145
00:05:37.717 --> 00:05:38.899
they should avoid the Ethics Tube

146
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.797
and come out spineless enough to do their job.

147
00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:42.549
Right. Wait, why are the athletes

148
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.719
going through the introvert sector?

149
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.897
Obviously so they can bully the mathematicians

150
00:05:45.898 --> 00:05:48.554
- and give us astronomers. - God, you are such a space nerd.

151
00:05:48.555 --> 00:05:50.819
I'm not a nerd. We're raising a society here, Beth.

152
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.189
If we want them to be self-sufficient,

153
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.315
they need to get out into space.

154
00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:55.773
Birth cycle. Coming.

155
00:05:55.774 --> 00:05:57.985
We got you, Gai-Gai! Shoot 'em hard and up the middle!

156
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.687
We got an oversupply of teachers

157
00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:16.198
putting a strain on the literary drive.

158
00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.379
Activating playwright converter!

159
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.449
Aah!

160
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.899
Nice work, honey. Okay, the therapists are getting bored.

161
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.769
We need to increase their supply of incest porn.

162
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.059
20% wasn't enough?

163
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.384
What the hell is that?

164
00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:27.749
The unproductives. Goddamn it!

165
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.767
- How are there so many of them? - Unproductives?

166
00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:31.867
Yeah, deejays, foodies, influencers.

167
00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:34.020
I just re-circulate them through until...

168
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.897
[BLEEP] they blew a hole in the human resources department!

169
00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:37.899
- You're fired! - Downsizing already?

170
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.160
I'm putting this in your file!

171
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.519
We gotta fix this, Dad.

172
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.072
We can't keep recycling them through.

173
00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:46.219
I could add an online college workaround.

174
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.419
Or just push them out through a pipe in the back.

175
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.784
- Same thing. - Same thing.

176
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:52.259
These kids may not be mine, but you definitely are.

177
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.499
Look at you. My little steampunk overlord.

178
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.700
Eeee!

179
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.209
I don't think he's coming back.

180
00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.759
You know, you... you really messed him up, Summer.

181
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.199
Yeah, well, he called me a lemur.

182
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.379
Let's just go find Grandpa.

183
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.219
Maybe he can portal us home or something.

184
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.059
- Should we leave a note? - Dad is fine.

185
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.430
He's probably sucking off a tree

186
00:07:07.438 --> 00:07:09.807
and having the time of his life right now.

187
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.940
Guess you don't want to learn how to skip rocks, either.

188
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.607
Aah!

189
00:07:15.608 --> 00:07:18.777
Aaah!

190
00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:20.639
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

191
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.979
Aaaaaah!

192
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.219
Ohh!

193
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.406
Aaaaaah!

194
00:07:26.407 --> 00:07:27.857
Gah!

195
00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:30.319
Ohhhh! Aaah!

196
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.810
Aah!

197
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.499
Aah!

198
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.092
Aaah!

199
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.879
Ow! Hey!

200
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.519
Aah!

201
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.179
Aaaaah!

202
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.144
Aaaaaaaah!

203
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.849
Ohh!

204
00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:02.443
_

205
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.788
Who are you guys?

206
00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:08.158
We are... unproductives.

207
00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:09.741
Ahh, I get it.

208
00:08:09.742 --> 00:08:11.940
Bunch of bull-[BLEEP].

209
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:17.437
What is that?

210
00:08:17.438 --> 00:08:20.469
This? This is camping.

211
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.479
Camping? Ooh!

212
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.504
Camping!

213
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:26.539
Camping! Camping! Camping!

214
00:08:40.064 --> 00:08:42.107
_

215
00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:57.147
Good work there, TickTock.

216
00:08:57.148 --> 00:08:59.007
Keep whittling. Incredible.

217
00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:01.347
You've almost got smoke over there, Florflock.

218
00:09:01.348 --> 00:09:02.847
There you go, guys!

219
00:09:02.848 --> 00:09:04.017
Pump those cheeks.

220
00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:05.717
That's the camping spirit.

221
00:09:05.718 --> 00:09:07.423
What the... Squeeb!

222
00:09:07.424 --> 00:09:08.718
This is not a tent.

223
00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:10.657
It is a new kind of tent,

224
00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:14.028
with special gutters to funnel the rain, and a door.

225
00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:15.259
It's a house!

226
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.139
No houses! No doors!

227
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.069
Once you have doors, you have indoors.

228
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.439
Once you have indoors, you won't want to camp anymore.

229
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.640
Then why do they not camp?

230
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.407
Because they're bad.

231
00:09:27.408 --> 00:09:29.520
Bad. Bad. Bad.

232
00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:31.322
Bad. Bad. Bad.

233
00:09:31.323 --> 00:09:33.717
Oh, my God. Maybe Dad was right.

234
00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:35.347
Maybe we have no life skills.

235
00:09:35.348 --> 00:09:37.387
I've definitely drank more pee than I care to remember.

236
00:09:37.388 --> 00:09:39.047
I'm just gonna sit down.

237
00:09:39.048 --> 00:09:41.667
If I die, don't eat my ass. That'd be weird.

238
00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:43.470
Uh, Summer?

239
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.258
Damn, you think they got infected

240
00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:50.759
by a mind slug or something?

241
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.899
Probably drove through a nebula

242
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.300
that made them see their own fears.

243
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.469
Whoa!

244
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.970
These controls.

245
00:09:59.977 --> 00:10:02.037
It's just like my video game controllers.

246
00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:04.650
I just wish I could read these symbols.

247
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.570
This looks just like Tricia's bong.

248
00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:12.487
Morty, I think these tubes might contain

249
00:10:12.488 --> 00:10:14.116
all of their collective knowledge.

250
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.879
- Mm! - Well?

251
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.833
I think we got this, bro.

252
00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:26.679
Beth, you wanna do the honors?

253
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.462
What? Really? Wow. Okay.

254
00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:29.840
- _ - Here we go.

255
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.419
If you told me six days ago I'd be christening

256
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.804
a generation ship for my half-rock children,

257
00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:37.179
I would've called you crazy.

258
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.483
But I guess that's the lesson... crazy things happen

259
00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:41.976
when you put in the work. Salud!

260
00:10:41.977 --> 00:10:44.228
[BLEEP] Doopnar! Sing something!

261
00:10:45.623 --> 00:10:47.659
- Great toast, Dad. - Thanks, sweetie.

262
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.699
Damn, listen to those pipes.

263
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.157
You sure these kids are yours?

264
00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:52.857
What, you've never heard me sing karaoke?

265
00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:54.797
I'm... I'm pretty good when someone's in my register,

266
00:10:54.798 --> 00:10:56.527
like the guy that sings "Circle of Life."

267
00:10:56.528 --> 00:10:58.458
Can't remember his name. Dresses up weird.

268
00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:01.428
Look at this. Everyone's happy.

269
00:11:01.429 --> 00:11:03.167
They're about to go into space.

270
00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:05.249
I know things haven't always been great with us,

271
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.543
but we do make a pretty good team.

272
00:11:07.544 --> 00:11:09.629
Uh, Rick? Can we talk?

273
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.617
Kinda in the middle of a breakthrough with my daughter.

274
00:11:11.618 --> 00:11:13.879
Go ahead, Dad. Gaia deserves some time, too.

275
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.129
- They're your kids. - Yes, about that.

276
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.806
Pam! It's good to see you, baby!

277
00:11:20.807 --> 00:11:23.309
Um, Gaia? You know this guy?

278
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.269
Ha! You call her Gaia? So lame.

279
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.979
Is that... God?

280
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.149
Rick. The kids. I messed up.

281
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.569
- You're not their father. - Little ones!

282
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.570
Daddy's here!

283
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:35.837
I'm sending some fog down.

284
00:11:35.838 --> 00:11:38.449
- Feel my presence through the fog! - Ooh!

285
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.520
Beth! What the [BLEEP]. Don't touch it!

286
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.081
You gotta be kidding me. God is the father?

287
00:11:44.082 --> 00:11:45.919
No hard feelings, okay?

288
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.500
We thought they were yours, you know,

289
00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:49.502
because they're so small.

290
00:11:49.503 --> 00:11:51.808
Oh, wow. No hard feelings. Y-You hear that, Beth?

291
00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:54.244
Guy swoops in after we raised his whole civilization

292
00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:56.426
and tells us he forgives us. What a [BLEEP] mooch!

293
00:11:56.427 --> 00:11:58.844
Don't push me, asshole!

294
00:11:58.845 --> 00:12:01.317
Rick, I think you should go.

295
00:12:01.318 --> 00:12:03.857
Seriously? You really want this pile of dry ice

296
00:12:03.858 --> 00:12:04.933
to raise your kids?

297
00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:07.097
Stop acting like you did a good job.

298
00:12:07.098 --> 00:12:10.219
You made my kids soft and empty inside.

299
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.539
This city is a monument to nothing!

300
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.777
Where is their faith?

301
00:12:13.778 --> 00:12:15.139
Reggie is right.

302
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.359
The children are not ready to leave.

303
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.679
He can give them more.

304
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.677
I mean, maybe we should just bail, Dad.

305
00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:23.077
At least this guy is immortal and can stick around.

306
00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:25.077
Bull-[BLEEP]. They're my kids! We're staying!

307
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.747
Bad! Bad!

308
00:12:26.748 --> 00:12:29.332
See? Now, this is the kind of shit I'm talking about.

309
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:33.119
- Bad! Bad! - Jerry! Oh, my God! Is that you?

310
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.004
- What the hell are you doing? - Camping.

311
00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:36.880
Oh, look, Jerry finally found his people.

312
00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:38.884
All it took was a deep enough drip pan.

313
00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:41.257
You labeled these creatures "unproductive,"

314
00:12:41.258 --> 00:12:43.597
but I have given them more purpose than ever.

315
00:12:43.598 --> 00:12:45.599
Oh, yeah? They filing your unemployment forms?

316
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.897
His tongue is sharp, but it cannot whittle.

317
00:12:47.898 --> 00:12:49.934
The Great Roughing of It is at hand.

318
00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.839
You will now join the One Family

319
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.468
on its Eternal Getaway.

320
00:12:53.469 --> 00:12:57.038
Or join the embers over which we hold marshmallows

321
00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.707
at just the right distance.

322
00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:02.099
Six inches! Until it gets golden brown!

323
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.879
Don't let it start on fire!

324
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.746
The carbon is bad for you!

325
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.079
What's happening?

326
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.679
My children, I give you my power.

327
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.827
Use it to take what is yours.

328
00:13:13.828 --> 00:13:16.213
Oh, this mother-[BLEEP]. Raise the walls!

329
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:22.589
Walls can't stop us, Rick. We are chosen.

330
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.764
Sha-boom-boom!

331
00:13:24.468 --> 00:13:25.967
Sorry! Sorry!

332
00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:27.516
Just trying to get the hang of this thing.

333
00:13:27.517 --> 00:13:29.807
Nice choice of chosen people, G-diddles.

334
00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.788
I guess you'll be playing the "mysterious ways" card

335
00:13:31.789 --> 00:13:33.379
- on that one. - You wanna go, bro?

336
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.941
I'll kick your ass myself.

337
00:13:34.942 --> 00:13:36.317
Oh, dude, don't tempt me.

338
00:13:36.318 --> 00:13:38.078
When I'm done with you, you'll need a staff

339
00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:39.612
to un-part your [BLEEP] face.

340
00:13:39.613 --> 00:13:42.199
Guys. Please. Not in front of the kids.

341
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.984
Did you for real just try to smite me?

342
00:13:45.985 --> 00:13:47.704
Siri, triangulate source of power.

343
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.859
Got you now, you son of a bitch.

344
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.096
Sweetie, you handle the hippies.

345
00:13:52.098 --> 00:13:53.464
I'll handle the off-brand Yahweh.

346
00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.587
- Kick his ass, Dad! - Bear witness.

347
00:14:01.593 --> 00:14:04.637
Now you see my true form.

348
00:14:04.638 --> 00:14:08.682
The clouds were simply a shape more appealing to Gaia's mind.

349
00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:10.644
No shit. Any form is more appealing than this.

350
00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:12.679
You look like Kid Rock [BLEEP] Zeus.

351
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.623
Oh, seriously, you expect me to fight you like this?

352
00:14:14.624 --> 00:14:16.817
You're the size of four Empire State Buildings.

353
00:14:16.818 --> 00:14:19.912
All right, mother-[BLEEP]. Let's go.

354
00:14:36.138 --> 00:14:39.589
Aaah! Aah!

355
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.713
Ha-ha! You like that?

356
00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.593
- Ohh! - Here comes some pain!

357
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.000
Ohh!

358
00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.880
Ow!

359
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.220
Ow!

360
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.759
And... that last one should be...

361
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.219
the start button.

362
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.877
Perfect. I guess we're ready.

363
00:15:13.878 --> 00:15:15.947
Let's show Mom and Dad what video games

364
00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:18.169
and partying are all about.

365
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.554
Jesus Christ, was that the wings?

366
00:15:29.688 --> 00:15:31.527
This is not like a video game!

367
00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:33.601
- It's not like a video game at all! - Oh, my God, make it stop! Make it stop!

368
00:15:33.602 --> 00:15:36.854
- How do I make it stop?! - I don't know. I'm [BLEEP] high!

369
00:15:36.855 --> 00:15:38.967
Aah!

370
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.979
Oh, God, now I'm high, too!

371
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.159
- Jerry, that's enough. - Oh, hey, babe.

372
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.785
You like these plagues I'm unleashing on your asses?

373
00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:53.859
No, they're lame. It's not a great sign

374
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.040
that your army's on the same side as disease.

375
00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:59.469
Sorry we aren't modern enough to sort people by value

376
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.005
and shit the losers through a mean butt tube!

377
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.551
Just admit this is about you wanting to feel needed!

378
00:16:07.552 --> 00:16:09.597
Says the woman who sold out her family

379
00:16:09.598 --> 00:16:12.014
for an ounce of approval from her drunk father!

380
00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:13.994
Well, maybe he drinks because it isn't easy

381
00:16:13.995 --> 00:16:15.351
to be more powerful than God.

382
00:16:15.352 --> 00:16:16.567
Well, if it's god power

383
00:16:16.568 --> 00:16:18.407
that gets you going, light some candles

384
00:16:18.408 --> 00:16:21.319
and put on the Billy Ocean because Moses is home

385
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.499
and he's ready to burn some bush!

386
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.110
Sha-boom-boom!

387
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.109
Ohh! [BLEEP]

388
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.347
Ow! All right, all right, stop.

389
00:16:30.348 --> 00:16:32.368
- Come on, bitch! - Look, you win, okay?

390
00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:33.829
Ju... I don't care about the kids.

391
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.587
Smite them, raise them to [BLEEP] sheep.

392
00:16:35.588 --> 00:16:37.187
Just keep the city, okay?

393
00:16:37.188 --> 00:16:38.439
My daughter and I built that thing.

394
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.960
- It's important to her. - No, bro. I'm a Zeus.

395
00:16:40.961 --> 00:16:43.427
I can literally do anything.

396
00:16:43.428 --> 00:16:46.090
Think I'm gonna hang around and raise kids?

397
00:16:46.091 --> 00:16:50.267
The only lesson they need is right here... fear.

398
00:16:50.268 --> 00:16:52.471
And it looks like school's out, bitch.

399
00:16:52.472 --> 00:16:54.429
I-I think you mean school's in.

400
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.959
What are... What are you talking about?

401
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.117
I-If you're teaching fear,

402
00:16:57.118 --> 00:16:59.520
then choking me... school would be in.

403
00:16:59.521 --> 00:17:01.790
Fine. School's in, bitch.

404
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.650
Oh.

405
00:17:04.651 --> 00:17:05.819
What the [BLEEP].

406
00:17:11.825 --> 00:17:14.157
Ohh! Are we dead? D-Did we die?

407
00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.537
I don't ever want to be high again.

408
00:17:15.538 --> 00:17:16.827
I-I got scared straight.

409
00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.297
Oh, my God, I got scared straight.

410
00:17:18.298 --> 00:17:19.667
[BLEEP] Dad was right.

411
00:17:19.668 --> 00:17:20.907
We... We think we know everything,

412
00:17:20.908 --> 00:17:22.268
but maybe we're the ones who suck.

413
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.963
You kids are my [BLEEP] heroes!

414
00:17:25.964 --> 00:17:28.439
You saved Grandpa's life! I [BLEEP] love you so much!

415
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.729
- Papa! - Papa!

416
00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.699
We played video games and got high! We did wrong!

417
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.487
- We did wrong! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, little boopas.

418
00:17:33.488 --> 00:17:36.499
Come on, now. You kids, you did real good here.

419
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.600
You did good.

420
00:17:37.601 --> 00:17:39.357
Getting high and playing video games is the best,

421
00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:40.429
I swear to [BLEEP] God.

422
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.619
But Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

423
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.687
No, hey, hey, look, no.

424
00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:45.318
[BLEEP] your mom and dad. Your parents are a bag of dicks.

425
00:17:45.319 --> 00:17:47.327
Getting high and playing video games is the best,

426
00:17:47.328 --> 00:17:49.257
and I will never sell you out, ever.

427
00:17:49.258 --> 00:17:50.279
Now, we got to get out of here

428
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.679
before this guy falls out of the sky.

429
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.878
He's generating an ionic cloud

430
00:17:52.879 --> 00:17:54.219
from his own belief system.

431
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.959
Holy [BLEEP]. Summer, were you smoking this?

432
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.580
You were basically inhaling brake fluid. Jesus!

433
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.368
Mm, yeah.

434
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.547
It's over, Beth. Tell your people to lower the gates

435
00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:12.417
and pack their moisture-wicking shirts.

436
00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:14.247
Incoming!

437
00:18:21.028 --> 00:18:22.739
Jerry!

438
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.980
Beth! Just hold on!

439
00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:26.733
I'm losing my grip!

440
00:18:28.526 --> 00:18:30.239
- Jerry. - Squeeb?

441
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.099
Use the s'more, Jerry.

442
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.367
- Ow! You stabbed my hand! - Sorry! Sorry!

443
00:18:39.278 --> 00:18:41.204
Should... Should we make love?

444
00:18:41.205 --> 00:18:42.319
Jerry, I love you,

445
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.659
but I can literally smell your balls from here.

446
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.709
Oh, wow.

447
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.387
Ask God for a flood next time. It'll come with a shower.

448
00:18:48.388 --> 00:18:49.660
Noted.

449
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.257
Aw, geez, that... that poor guy.

450
00:18:52.258 --> 00:18:53.787
Can you maybe not tell Mom and Dad?

451
00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:56.288
Relax, it's just a Zeus. If this was the real God, it...

452
00:18:56.289 --> 00:18:58.514
it'd be a completely different story.

453
00:18:58.515 --> 00:19:01.427
Rick! What did you do?!

454
00:19:01.428 --> 00:19:02.928
I mean, gravity did most of it.

455
00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:06.063
- So, you, technically. - I told you to leave!

456
00:19:06.064 --> 00:19:08.137
Yeah, well, you also asked me to raise your kids.

457
00:19:08.138 --> 00:19:10.734
Uh, not sure if you heard the phrase, "pick a lane," but...

458
00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:12.361
You killed their father!

459
00:19:12.362 --> 00:19:14.277
Father or not, he was a lying piece of [BLEEP].

460
00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:16.105
I don't care who else stuffed your crust,

461
00:19:16.106 --> 00:19:17.539
but I'm the guy that showed up.

462
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.619
But I mean, if you want,

463
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.204
I can still power-wash his guts off the tower and maybe...

464
00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:22.529
Get oooout!

465
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.899
Okay, yeah, she's pissed.

466
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.791
I mean, you killed her slam piece, Grandpa.

467
00:19:25.792 --> 00:19:27.300
I don't blame her.

468
00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:44.144
See? You put the fire stick to the wood, and, voilÃ !

469
00:19:44.145 --> 00:19:45.149
Campfire.

470
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.199
You have known about this the whole time?

471
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.969
I'm not gonna waste my time building you an ark,

472
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.239
but if your mom gets clingy,

473
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.677
you can use this to get some space.

474
00:19:51.678 --> 00:19:54.111
Is that all you want to say to your children before you leave?

475
00:19:54.112 --> 00:19:57.031
Oh, yeah, uh, don't ask me for money.

476
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.680
I mean, Gaia's not gonna raise those guys

477
00:20:01.688 --> 00:20:03.557
to hunt us down, right?

478
00:20:03.558 --> 00:20:05.657
Oh, most definitely. I put a tracker on their ship.

479
00:20:05.658 --> 00:20:07.416
I'll blow it up if they come anywhere near me.

480
00:20:07.417 --> 00:20:09.375
Well, kids, never thought I'd say this,

481
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.567
- but, Summer, you were right. - Wait, what?

482
00:20:11.568 --> 00:20:13.797
I thought I wanted to teach you guys about tents,

483
00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:15.964
but really, I just wanted to feel important.

484
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.679
I guess sometimes teenagers do know

485
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.837
what they're talking about, even if it's mean.

486
00:20:19.838 --> 00:20:22.877
Right, but didn't you, like, go into god-mode and fight Mom?

487
00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:25.017
Love is the only power that matters, Morty.

488
00:20:25.018 --> 00:20:27.374
No, you had actual power, and you did jack shit.

489
00:20:27.375 --> 00:20:28.599
That was a divine staff.

490
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.355
You could've cured cancer or raised the dead.

491
00:20:30.356 --> 00:20:33.157
- Instead you made bugs. - Well, I was impressed, Dad.

492
00:20:33.158 --> 00:20:35.730
He saved my life, no thanks to you.

493
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.657
Your kids got high on alien mist

494
00:20:39.658 --> 00:20:41.237
and drove the ship into that Zeus guy's head.

495
00:20:41.238 --> 00:20:42.499
- Basically murdered him. - Grandpa!

496
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.509
- What the hell?! - Come on!

497
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.039
What? You did. I mean, not to cast the first stone,

498
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.677
but, Beth and Jerry, pretty terrible parenting on your part.

499
00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:49.364
Did you know Summer huffed a K-Zax Array?

500
00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:50.899
She basically smoked "The Ring."

501
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.489
Most pilots die after three days.

502
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.699
And Morty, the [BLEEP] moron,

503
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.877
he thought the ship worked like a game controller.

504
00:20:55.878 --> 00:20:57.707
What in the Disney Channel [BLEEP] is that?

505
00:20:57.708 --> 00:20:59.347
Maybe help him with homework next time.

506
00:20:59.348 --> 00:21:01.178
He's clearly crying for help.

507
00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:35.755
Planets Only. Planets Only. Planets Only.

508
00:21:35.756 --> 00:21:38.769
Entire systems of steamy, lush globes

509
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.587
and barely habitable celestial objects

510
00:21:41.588 --> 00:21:43.971
are drifting through the void just for you.

511
00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:46.079
- Planets Only. - Let's terraform.

512
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.434
- Or colonize me as I am. - Planets Only.

513
00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:51.555
Oops, there's a hole in my ozone.

514
00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:53.539
I didn't put it there. Did you?

515
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.419
I can't fill it by myself.

516
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.779
I'm not smart enough.

517
00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.459
Young, dumb, and orbiting the sun.

518
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.637
The greenhouse is in full effect at Planets Only.

519
00:22:02.638 --> 00:22:05.701
Oh, I want you to split my Pangea into distinct continents.

520
00:22:05.702 --> 00:22:08.179
I don't have hydrostatic equilibrium yet.

521
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.872
Is that something you can learn?

522
00:22:09.873 --> 00:22:12.969
You get the idea.

523
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.979
Phew!

524
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.958
I was watching over your shoulder for a full minute.

525
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.519
So? I was watching because it's funny.

526
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.868
It's... It's... They... They... They're planets,

527
00:22:18.869 --> 00:22:21.059
but they're sexy. It's a comedic premise.

528
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.797
- Yeah. - Planets Only.

529
00:22:23.798 --> 00:22:25.305
Planets Only.
