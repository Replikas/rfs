1
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.090
Oh!

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.710
Um, hey, Rick.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.480
I was wondering if you could help me out

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.410
with a bit of a rake situation.

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.880
- A "rake situation"? - Long story short,

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.811
I asked Gene if he borrowed my rake,

7
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.400
and he said, "No," like... like that. Like, too fast.

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.920
Like, faster than someone should know they don't have my rake.

9
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.060
I think he has my rake, and I...

10
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.600
I'm not going to murder Gene.

11
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.330
Jerry, thank you for bringing me into The Rake Situation.

12
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.640
I've done all I can. I'm out.

13
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.910
No surprise there.

14
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.160
All that brain, and you just waste it.

15
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.320
H-Hold up.

16
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.120
- I-I waste my brain? - Yeah, Rick.

17
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.090
Obviously, you were born smarter than me,

18
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.110
- but if I had your brain... - If you had my...

19
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.940
I am so sick of this "born smart" shit.

20
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.000
Are you gonna kill me?

21
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.380
I was born crying and pissing myself, just like you.

22
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.029
Then I become the smartest man in the universe,

23
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.040
and do I get credit?

24
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.472
No, I get to check my brain privilege.

25
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.849
So we're swapping bodies?

26
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.199
No, that would be "Freaky Friday,"

27
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.352
which is the ceiling of your grasp of consciousness.

28
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.340
The brain is part of the body, Jerry. It's hardware.

29
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.430
I'm gonna put my mind in your brain

30
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.320
and your mind in my brain.

31
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.240
Then we'll see the real definition of "waste," Jerry.

32
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.830
Or, you know, admit genius isn't random

33
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.040
- and your failures are your own. - Oh, not doing that.

34
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.100
Thought as much.

35
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.540
Oh, furck. Oh, grod.

36
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.510
Wait, no!

37
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.130
Okay. Hold on. Hold on.

38
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.970
Oh-ho-ho, whoa, whoa, whoa!

39
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.500
All right, Jerry, you can do this.

40
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.370
Whoa!

41
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.800
Medical emergency detected.

42
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.290
_

43
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.590
There goes my Thursday.

44
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.820
I'm telling you, man, you're making a big mistake here.

45
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.170
Ha! Bigger mistake than being a criminal?

46
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.801
I'm mistake-proof.

47
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.440
Sorry to bother, boss.

48
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.340
I caught this punk selling crystals on our turf...

49
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.980
You big, precious moron.

50
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.170
D-Do you know who the fuck... This is Morty.

51
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.564
The kid who hangs with Rick Sanchez.

52
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.857
Tried to warn you, man.

53
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.120
- Rick Sanchez? - Underworld legend?

54
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.140
Chaotic neutral sci-fi guy? Huh?

55
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.960
Christ, he's gonna turn me into a sandwich.

56
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.220
What is this guy, fuckin' new?

57
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.720
Think he was a Dylan rec, boss.

58
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.990
Well, check those fucking references next time.

59
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.320
Whatever this kid wants to do in our territory is his business.

60
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.620
Fuck. Fuck! Call my wife.

61
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.040
We gotta prep go-bags three through six.

62
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.020
Hey, pal. You good? You whole?

63
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.440
Y-You guys have milkshakes?

64
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.630
We will learn what they are and get you one.

65
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.080
What a turn.

66
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.530
Lucky I'm such a genius your garage can thwart death.

67
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.018
I'm the genius, and it's your garage, idiot.

68
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.140
Hey, what the fuck did you do to my body?

69
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.360
Your body? Jerry, your mind did that to my body

70
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.580
- using my brain. - Jerry, my mind was in this brain

71
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.640
in your body.

72
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.120
Pretty easy to follow.

73
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.198
It shuffled us.

74
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.283
Shuffled you maybe. I'm tracking everything.

75
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.520
Garage? Fix this.

76
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.328
Situation was fixed.

77
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.700
You call this fixed?

78
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.049
- This guy thinks he's me. - This guy thinks he's me.

79
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.160
Let's see you fix it, then, asshole.

80
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.200
I fucking will.

81
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.200
I got my lab right here. Gimme three hours.

82
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.140
Oh, sure, yeah, l-like I'd ever trust you to open my skull.

83
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.020
I'll fix it. I just need to scan for... Ow!

84
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.440
Like I'd trust your fritzing R2-D2 ass.

85
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.990
You'll just kill me on purpose.

86
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.660
So that's where my paranoia went.

87
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.800
Rick speaking. Who is this?

88
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.480
Rick, it's Chuxly. From Crimetown.

89
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.080
We've met 5 or 10 times.

90
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.700
Listen, small misunderstanding.

91
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.050
One of my guys saw your buddy Morty running an errand

92
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.940
and he brought him in, which I told him not to do,

93
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.020
but I've got Morty, and he is fine.

94
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.329
Wait, w-what? Aren't you describing kidnapping?

95
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.589
- Morty's kidnapped? - No, no, no.

96
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.350
Give me that, Jerry. Hello? Hello?

97
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.700
This is Rick Sanchez.

98
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.140
I'm using my son-in-law's vocal cords because I'm amazing.

99
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.260
If you touch my grandson, I'm gonna...

100
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.370
- Get... Get off me. - H-H-Hello?

101
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.060
Jerry, stop. You're fucking this up.

102
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.129
You're only calling me Jerry because you're so stupid

103
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.360
you think it's hurtful, which it is.

104
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.480
Tell me where you are.

105
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.260
No, you tell them where they are, like Liam Neeson.

106
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.620
Do not pretend to explain Liam Neeson to me. Sir.

107
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.440
- Hey, Jerry, don't touch me there. - Stop it.

108
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.400
- We know where you are. - We know where you are.

109
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.357
- My milkshake is empty! - Okay!

110
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.860
That was so embarrassing.

111
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.449
Do you have any clue what a pain it is

112
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.710
to cultivate a mystique?

113
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.560
Yeah, I do. It's my mystique,

114
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.780
and you're just cultivating Jerry's shame.

115
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.799
What is with my hair?

116
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.810
- Don't. - Leave it.

117
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.230
- Why do you care about hair, nerd? - Be quiet for a second,

118
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.747
I need to think through all these chunks of moron.

119
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.990
Okay, you stay here.

120
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.542
Touch nothing. I'll get Morty.

121
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.230
Ha! I'm not letting you get Morty killed

122
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.129
and our brains blown out twice.

123
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.548
Car, electrocute Jerry if he gets in the front seat.

124
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.080
Car, engage castration protocol right now.

125
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.080
Figure out how to drive me together

126
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.100
or I will have to kill you both.

127
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.300
Ugh! What are we, a 1930s comedy act?

128
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.940
- Stop swerving. - You're swerving.

129
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.240
All right, when we get there, let me do the talking.

130
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.300
Yeah, I know, because you look the most like us.

131
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.750
- I'm not stupid. - Ho-ho! I beg to differ.

132
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.060
Screw you, Half Jerry.

133
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.860
- You're a Half Jerry! - You're a Half Jerry!

134
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.360
Looks like he's inbound, boss.

135
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.800
Okay, he is in a bad mood,

136
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.955
so we are kissing ass until our lips are ass-colored.

137
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.080
Straighten that pillow. He might hate crooked pillows.

138
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.110
I don't know.

139
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.790
Nice parking job, assdick. You scratched my car.

140
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.200
Rick! And... And, uh, Rick's friend.

141
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.420
This is my... assassin.

142
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.440
Deadliest man in the galaxy, and he's gay.

143
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.779
- Why am I gay? - Whoa.

144
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.440
- Hey. - Whoa. Why aren't you?

145
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.210
Sorry about that. Sorry. Sorry.

146
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.020
Well, I got Morty right here,

147
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.460
happy as a milkshake.

148
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.200
And since we interrupted your day,

149
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.000
Morty's got 10,000 croutons.

150
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.840
That's slang for crystals. Morty, show him.

151
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.500
- We know what croutons are. - Ey! Tsh.

152
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.660
Why is Dad here?

153
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.830
Your dad's a gay assassin?

154
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.060
So cool and ordinary. Sorry. S-Sorry.

155
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.720
I appreciate you trying to make good,

156
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.500
but you cost me 10 times that much.

157
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.900
It doesn't matter, Rick.

158
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.310
The guy's already kissing your ass.

159
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.380
It's the ass kissers you have to keep in line.

160
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.039
When they sense weakness, they move on you.

161
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.320
What are we, Walter White?

162
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.216
Who cares if a mid-tier crime dork "moves" on us?

163
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.220
Thank you for the crystals. Morty, get in the car.

164
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.700
Actually, Morty, why don't you leave those crystals here

165
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.880
since it's such an insulting amount.

166
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.899
There it is. Now he's thinking, "Oh, maybe I can kill God."

167
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.390
Yeah, because God doesn't haggle

168
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.480
for 10,000 fucking croutons.

169
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.560
Look, here's the deal.

170
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.290
I'm Rick, that's my son-in-law,

171
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.850
and we're all a little gay.

172
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.320
- Yeah. - It's a spectrum.

173
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.700
Morty, it's me, Rick. Get in the car.

174
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.020
Don't get in the car, Morty.

175
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.500
And put the briefcase down.

176
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.990
Morty, get in the car twice,

177
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.120
once for each five additional briefcases this asshole owes us.

178
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.120
Stop doing this terrible impression of me!

179
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.790
Look, at this point, we're bad gangsters

180
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.840
if we don't roll the dice.

181
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.480
Everybody, start killing 'em!

182
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.480
What have you two assholes done?

183
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.260
It's okay. It's a nice restaurant.

184
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.459
- Whoa. - Shit!

185
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.469
Crime restaurant!

186
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.380
Oh, my God! Am I really about to die

187
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.555
- because you botched a "Freaky Friday"? - Yes.

188
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.939
Whoever you are, you're in Rick's body.

189
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.860
- Use your implants. - I'm trying.

190
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.619
Half my brain is the guy that still needs your mom

191
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.360
to use the electric wine opener.

192
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.820
H-Hang on. I think I got it.

193
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.401
Right, from my Conehead phase.

194
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.520
- Awesome fucking movie. - Incredible cast.

195
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.620
God damn it.

196
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.780
I'm shooting my way back to the car.

197
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.140
Ugh, way to go.

198
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.210
Now my son and grandson hates us.

199
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.520
He's my son and grandson, too.

200
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.560
Huh.

201
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.900
We do share an agenda, in that sense.

202
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.460
Let's hope you share my aim.

203
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.720
âª Fall is here, hear the yell âª

204
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.340
âª Back to school, ring the bell âª

205
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.927
âª Brand new shoes, walking blues âª

206
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.388
âª Climb the fence, books and pens âª

207
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.960
âª I can tell that we are gonna be friends âª

208
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.400
Hey, get up here!

209
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.311
- Said the throat to the hand. - Oh! Oh!

210
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.680
You might feel a pinch and maybe a rocket.

211
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.280
You'll have to aim. Hop on!

212
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.920
âª I can tell that we are gonna be friends âª

213
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.220
âª I can tell that we are gonna be friends âª

214
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.540
You Coneheaded son of a bitch.

215
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.600
Can't believe that worked.

216
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.200
I wish they did that in the movie.

217
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.418
Jesus fucking Christ.

218
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.420
Huh, should've done something with my hands.

219
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.631
Morty, gotta push or pull. Your call.

220
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.600
What the hell? What happened?

221
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.480
T-They made us stop at every drive-thru chain in the galaxy,

222
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.210
so they could make one giant burger

223
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.780
with a patty from each place.

224
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.311
I guess I meant before that.

225
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.640
Brains got a little mixed up.

226
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.300
But we're gonna swap back. Don't worry.

227
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.100
Just didn't wanna build a neural interface

228
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.732
on an empty stomach, right?

229
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.400
Wait, you guys did a brain swap?

230
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.279
Don't bother chiding until they're unshuffled,

231
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.060
neither one is Dad or Rick.

232
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.460
Huh.

233
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.830
I guess I'm thrilled you guys are getting along?

234
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.660
Let's keep that going

235
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.170
when those brains get back in their bodies.

236
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.460
Whoa, going for the electro-pneumatic diodes.

237
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.660
- Wild man. - Only gonna build this once.

238
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.588
Gotta do it with style.

239
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.240
I think we can up the wattage.

240
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.270
Hey, another beer?

241
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.800
It's about the journey, brother.

242
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.340
Ah, Rick used to hate that kind of hang-loose McConaughey platitude,

243
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.250
but he was also just gonna spend today grumpy and isolated.

244
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.300
And Jerry'd still be hung up about the rake.

245
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.560
The rake. Oh, my God, should we do it?

246
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:05.649
W-We've gotta do it.

247
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.390
Oh, yeah.

248
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.120
All right, that should do it.

249
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:13.800
_

250
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.575
- _ - Whoa.

251
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.680
- Son of a bitch. - Classic Gene.

252
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.703
Huh.

253
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.200
Crazy. T-This is the kind of thing

254
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.560
that used to really piss me off.

255
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.960
Yeah. Now it's just kinda funny.

256
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.229
Ooh, you wanna replace it with a holographic rake?

257
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.259
Oh, that'd be fun.

258
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.130
He'd get confused trying to pick it up.

259
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.850
Eh. I guess I don't even wanna do that.

260
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.719
I just want to live. I want Gene to live.

261
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.550
I want all of us to make mistakes

262
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.320
- and change all the time. - Amen to that, brother.

263
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.160
Kinda thought two geniuses would build faster than one.

264
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.562
When do I start being concerned about this?

265
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.649
Just having a little fun with my new friend, sweetie.

266
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.839
Who is talking to me right now?

267
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.193
Mostly my dad or mostly my husband?

268
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.611
Oof, I've been on that website.

269
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.940
Look, I've been patient,

270
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.198
but I can't tell how to get mad at who.

271
00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.460
No one enters my room

272
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.080
or touches me until this is wrapped up.

273
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.460
- Eww. What do you take me for? - Ugh, Beth, gross, ugh.

274
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.280
I want you to know, when this is over,

275
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.220
the guy in this body is gonna yell at Jerry

276
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.360
and call him useless.

277
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.760
Really lay into him. But he won't always mean it.

278
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.320
Well, cards on the table,

279
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.595
the guy in this body might call Rick an angry old asshole.

280
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.560
But he's the closest thing Jerry has to a friend.

281
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.250
This was fun.

282
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.480
Rick would never have been able to admit that.

283
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.560
Yeah. It's a shame those guys had to become us to be happy.

284
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.240
Kids, breakfast and school.

285
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.509
If we don't at least pretend they matter,

286
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.800
everything falls apart.

287
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.460
Jerry? Dad?

288
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.900
Th-They left a note.

289
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.390
Should we read it in Rick's voice or Dad's?

290
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.470
"Dear family, we thought about leaving a note.

291
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.679
But then one of us was like, 'Why are we leaving a note?'

292
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.160
That's such a Jerry thing to do.

293
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.800
But if we didn't leave a note, that's such a Rick thing to do.

294
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.760
And then we realized, we just gotta be us.

295
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.210
So it's a note but it's not really well thought out."

296
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.820
That's it? They got out a pen and a paper for this?

297
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.250
Hey, did you guys get a note, too?

298
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.930
Mine's really long.

299
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.900
Beautiful day to be carrying glass, huh?

300
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.198
I can't believe a dying kid would wish for a window.

301
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.879
Damn it!

302
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.270
Hey! Stop them! They stole our crystals!

303
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.954
Yeah! We stole those first!

304
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.830
Possession is 9/10 of my ass!

305
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.820
Look at this pancake butt.

306
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.620
Stop. You're gonna make me fart.

307
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.762
Hey! That's for sipping!

308
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.320
- So are my balls. - Here's a tip, lady.

309
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.600
Life tastes better when you're chugging.

310
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.330
You were in a tree?

311
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.850
Really gambled on this escape route.

312
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.200
Says the guy with a goon on his back.

313
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.740
Forget it, Burger.

314
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.560
It's our calling card.

315
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.260
Oh, r-really called that one.

316
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.350
Eh, one of us always gets shot.

317
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.160
God damn it.

318
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.050
Hey. You'll never guess who just ripped us off.

319
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.340
Oh, wow. Good guess.

320
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.379
- Whoa! - Oh, man.

321
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.740
24 crystal heists in 24 hours!

322
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.440
We're two farts in the wind, baby!

323
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.600
Yeaahh! Do your Howard Dean scream.

324
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.300
Yeaahh!

325
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.232
5:00 somewhere. 5:00 somewhere.

326
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.200
God damn, look at us.

327
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.440
No rules. No responsibilities.

328
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.560
Just two best friends on the run.

329
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.150
- Yeaahh! - Yeaahh!

330
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.780
The voice mailbox for...

331
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.539
Uh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Did it beep?

332
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.850
Uh, my name is Jer...

333
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.248
... is full. Goodbye.

334
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.750
Looks like we just missed them.

335
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.630
So they just stick burgers in dead guy's mouths now?

336
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.670
In dead criminal's mouths, Summer.

337
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.910
- You're defending them? - Well, they were my husband

338
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.600
- and father. - Thanks for the tip, Blarb. It's weird.

339
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.580
Most of my underworld contacts are ghosting me.

340
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.940
My pleasure, Morty.

341
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.700
I should be thanking you for making me rich.

342
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.580
Wait. I-I didn't pay you for this.

343
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.010
Yeah, these guys did.

344
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.940
What's the problem, kid? Conehead got your tongue?

345
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.920
Ch-Ch-Chuxly? You're alive?

346
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.780
Did this guy always have a hole,

347
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.110
or is that a big reveal?

348
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.873
- Yeehaw! - Everything should be in a swamp.

349
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.780
Working with y'all was a plum-fool idea.

350
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.809
Burger & Fries.

351
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.820
Who the hell is this?

352
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.030
Just an average mid-tier crime dork.

353
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.580
Chuxly? You're alive?

354
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.120
Shut up. I got something you might wanna hear.

355
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.630
- Caught your family out looking for you. - What do you want?

356
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.580
We've smoked most of what we stole.

357
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.640
I just want you, both of you.

358
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.900
Or I smoke your family.

359
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.148
Eh, what am I saying? Sure, bring money, too. One hour.

360
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.040
Shit. Guess we should shoot the fuel tank, huh?

361
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.640
You guys coulda done that the whole time?

362
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.540
So. What now?

363
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.020
Hey, remember how we met?

364
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.110
That non-rescue of Morty?

365
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.180
We were thinking we were different

366
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.240
and... and accusing each other of being bad,

367
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.860
but Morty reminded us we both love our family.

368
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.980
And it brought us together.

369
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.730
Let's do this.

370
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.130
Well, if we're gonna do it right,

371
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.360
we might as well use our best idea.

372
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.116
You guys comfortable? No? Good.

373
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.730
Who are you? What is this place?

374
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.900
And does my son sell drugs for my father?

375
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.899
Hm, maybe criminals will actually be honest with me.

376
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.410
Crystals can be anything, Mom.

377
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.420
- Yeah, but these crystals are drugs. - Morty!

378
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.290
Here we go, boys. This is it.

379
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.339
Jerry?

380
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.380
- Rick? - Grandpa?

381
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.883
Jesus Christ.

382
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.020
Morty. Summer. Daughterwife.

383
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.260
You are safe now.

384
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.570
Holy shit. All the positive aspects of each,

385
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.180
perfectly melded together?

386
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.728
Yes. I am Jerricky. Wa-chah!

387
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.523
All right, boys, nothing could have prepared us for this.

388
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.983
At this point we gotta shoot and hope.

389
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.903
Also, everything's flammable.

390
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.820
Hey, guys, little help?

391
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.014
Gotta split?

392
00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.060
I'm sorry, Chux.

393
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.260
I started this. It's all my fault.

394
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.680
Solid apology, new guy.

395
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.730
If we live through this, you're off the hook.

396
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.020
Nice shot, Morty.

397
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.980
Eh, everything's flammable.

398
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.650
Aghh. What a family.

399
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.870
- You got shot? - No, no, no.

400
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.120
The stitches, they never really set.

401
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.290
What can I say? I'm a workaholic.

402
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.360
Agh. I knew this day would come.

403
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.660
Chuxly, this is a good death.

404
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.040
You sought mastery over your world.

405
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.720
No, no. I-I-I stepped out of line.

406
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.160
I thought I could kill God.

407
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.360
Being a boss in a crime world... oof.

408
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.740
So much stress.

409
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.980
Honestly, Jerricky, it's a relief to die in your four arms.

410
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.275
Final meal?

411
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.140
Mmm, mm.

412
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.079
How... H-How old is this?

413
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.730
Can we turn on the radio?

414
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.540
At this point, I'd even take a podcast.

415
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.380
Do you not hear the symphony of atoms dying in space?

416
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.630
Um, no?

417
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.200
Good. You are here.

418
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.340
I have modified the house defenses.

419
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.648
They will ensure the mob never bothers you again.

420
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.080
Oh. Thanks.

421
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.630
This is killing me.

422
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.500
I-I thought when you came to rescue us

423
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.999
you learned to love us more than ever.

424
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.323
Y-You learned the opposite?

425
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.770
Burger & Fries learned to love each other,

426
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.870
then sacrificed themselves out of love for you.

427
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.623
I am Jerricky, and I only need to love myself.

428
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.420
You can't actually be leaving, right?

429
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.660
- Like the crows thing? - They're my dad and grandpa.

430
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.049
Y-You can't just take them.

431
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.200
Your dad and grandpa are dead, Morty.

432
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.009
They died arguing with each other about their brains.

433
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.388
'Scuse me. Are... Are you Jerry?

434
00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.348
Sorry, you have one of his heads.

435
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.225
I am Jerricky.

436
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.480
May as well have your rake back, then.

437
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.020
That's right. I took it.

438
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.180
I ask myself, "Why lie about it? Don't you think he knows?

439
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.560
Couldn't I get my own?" Of course I could've,

440
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.140
but God damn it, this rake, it kept my neighbors in my life.

441
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.740
You guys don't give a Goddamn shit about Gene.

442
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.577
But I see that won't help me any longer. Here.

443
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.789
You are no longer obligated in such a way.

444
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.833
I'm gonna give it back anyway.

445
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.980
Just seems like the right thing to do.

446
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.260
Okay.

447
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.980
- Aw. - Oh, shit.

448
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.170
You think a rake will change my mind?

449
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.880
Well, it's fucking lame, okay?

450
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.560
Both of you walking out on Mom?

451
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.020
I thought you had two sets of balls, not zero.

452
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.730
Our balls are adeq...

453
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.070
Morty, we're still in here!

454
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.900
There's a memory of myself as a 30-year-old.

455
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.040
He kept our egos intact. He saved us.

456
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.419
It was a whole action movie, Morty.

457
00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.040
Memory Rick, he's still trapped in here.

458
00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.699
- Quick, tackle this fucking thing! - Hold him down!

459
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.660
- Garage! Garage! Help us! - Hold him down!

460
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.456
Nicely prepared eggs.

461
00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.650
I still can't taste anything.

462
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.210
Awesome adventure, Rick.

463
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.420
Jerry, being shuffled with me

464
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.600
was probably the best part of your sad existence.

465
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.257
A brush with greatness.

466
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.140
Please, like you didn't get an upgrade.

467
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.240
What was it like having integrity for once?

468
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.920
Hey, Beth, how much integrity is left on the mortgage?

469
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.850
I-I think it's clear you both love each other

470
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.059
more than you're willing to admit.

471
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.310
Dumb. Fucking dumb. Go pick up crystals for me.

472
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.770
You don't have to do that, Morty.

473
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.320
No, it's... it's okay. I-I like doing it.

474
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.840
Welp, those horses won't sew themselves up,

475
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.580
- but good to have you both back. - Yeah. Whatever.

476
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.909
Great, so I still wind up stuck with Jerry's dumb ass?

477
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.390
Oh, fuck you. Eat your eggs that my wife bought.

478
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.619
How about you eat my shit, you Hawaiian-shirt-loving twat?

479
00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.497
Uncalled for! Rude and uncalled for!

480
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.040
You sit there with your potty mouth

481
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.329
- and do everything but help. - Jerry, it's not my fault

482
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.739
- that nobody respects you in here. - Oh, yeah.

483
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.519
- Your own kids think... - You could help, but you don't.

484
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.700
I was busy, Jerry.

485
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.259
I was working on something very important.

486
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.000
âª Brand new shoes, walking blues âª

487
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.540
âª Climb the fence, books and pens âª

488
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.879
âª I can tell that we are gonna be friends âª

489
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.520
_

490
00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.560
âª I can tell that we are gonna be friends âª

491
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.580
âª Walk with me, Suzy Lee âª

492
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.270
âª Through the park and by the tree âª

493
00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.196
âª We will rest upon the ground âª

494
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.074
âª And look at all the bugs we found âª

495
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.952
âª Safely walk to school without a sound âª

496
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.667
âª Safely walk to school without a sound âª

497
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.463
âª I can tell that we are gonna be friends âª

498
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.426
âª I can tell that we are gonna be friends âª

499
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.304
And of course, there's a space shuttles.

500
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.920
Can you believe that giant thing actually flies?

501
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.390
Well, of course it can. It's a space shuttles.

502
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.520
And over here is some stuff about Thomas Jefferson.

503
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.620
Come on, students.

504
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.000
Day 8 of attempting to escape Jerry's mind.

505
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.697
It has become increasingly clear my daughter married a man

506
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.909
who remembers all technology as powered by springs and gears.

507
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.620
How did I get here?

508
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.400
I suspect a chunk of Rick's brain

509
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.260
got merged with a chunk of Jerry's.

510
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.220
But did Rick maroon me by accident?

511
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.200
Or on purpose?

512
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.100
Escape remains possible, but increasingly unlikely.

513
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.660
Oh, hey, Memory Rick.

514
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.806
Building more sculptures out of springs and gears?

515
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.929
Fuck off, Memory Gene.
