00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.380

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.300

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.890

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.271

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:28.390
_

8
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.480
Aah! What are you doing?!

9
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.520
Dad? Dad? Hello?

10
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.140
What is wrong with you?

11
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.600
Really?

12
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.825
Oh.

13
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.040
Okay.

14
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.660
Mornin', assholes.

15
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.335
What's this? Pancakes? Sold.

16
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.720
What was up with you last night?

17
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.500
I was totally talking to you and you acted like I wasn't there.

18
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.800
I did? Oh, yeah. No. That wasn't me.

19
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.339
Technically. That was my night person.

20
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.650
Been having him do crunches while I sleep. Check it.

21
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.924
- Damn! Check out that washboard, yo! - Hey. Too hard.

22
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.593
What the hell's a night person?

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.830
I nabbed a Somnambulator

24
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.260
while passing through the Goobie-Joob System last week.

25
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.040
Best investment I've ever made.

26
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.893
Before going to bed, I type a list of shit I want to get done.

27
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.280
Then the Somnambulator programs my unconscious body,

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.880
or "night person," to do it while I sleep.

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.220
I'm getting so much done.

30
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.890
C-Can my night person get me an ab stack like yours, Rick?

31
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.499
I'm gonna have my night person learn me Spanish

32
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.459
- so I can pass my test next week! - Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.160
- No one gets a night person but me. - Aw!

34
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.284
This tech is way too advanced for you zeebs.

35
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.920
- What? - Nothing.

36
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.706
No. Go on. Say it.

37
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.880
Say what? I don't know what you're talking about.

38
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.510
Okay! Fine! Fuck it!

39
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.924
Everybody gets a night person. Whatever.

40
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.218
Stick out your fingers. It needs a blood sample.

41
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.720
Blood? Can't I just give it Beth's credit card number?

42
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.180
This isn't Postmates, Jerry.

43
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.100
The Somnambulator needs your DNA profile

44
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.359
to send commands to your subconscious.

45
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.645
It can poke all the fingers I got if I get abs like Rick.

46
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.730
Well, looks like I'm learning the trumpet.

47
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.690
Okay. Remember, somebody has to catch me if I faint.

48
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.630
Yay! Night family!

49
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.571
- Whoo! - Oh.

50
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.897
_

51
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.710
Hola, mamÃ¡. Â¿CÃ³mo lo llevas?

52
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.570
How's my honor student doing?

53
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.600
Muy bien.

54
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.400
All the niÃ±os and niÃ±as at school

55
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.324
think I should run for class presidenta.

56
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.785
'Sup, ladies. Want to see somethin'?

57
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.719
Summer, you want to drop this bowling ball on my abs?

58
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.360
Hell, yeah. I'm only human.

59
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.460
Watch this.

60
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.462
'Sup, ladies. You ready, Morty? The stream's about to go live.

61
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.860
- Where are you two going? - Morty and I started a podcast

62
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.960
we call "FAB-solutely AB-ulous."

63
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.740
It's... It's an ab-centric hour of fun.

64
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.000
Hoping to get Nancy Pelosi on the show next week.

65
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.600
Want to drop her on our abs!

66
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.806
Yeah!

67
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.900
Guess who has a new pen pal!

68
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.930
No takers?

69
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.670
- It's me! - Pen pal?

70
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.560
Night Jerry and I write letters to each other.

71
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.060
- It's super fun. - "I also like Tori Amos."

72
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.000
"Hope you like our new pajamas."

73
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.140
"What is the sun?"

74
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.700
Jerry, this isn't how you're supposed to use a night person.

75
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.480
You two are being a couple of Debbie Down-theres.

76
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.060
Wait until Night Jerry reads about this.

77
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.290
Who wants cake?

78
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.240
- Abs are cool. - Way cool.

79
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.000
But as above, so below. Know what I'm sayin', Rick?

80
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.580
Morty, you must be referring to these excellent boxer shorts

81
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.970
we got from the good folks at Boxer Lobster.

82
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.339
Boxer Lobster Boxers feel like they're warm butter on your schwantz.

83
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.899
And they come in all sorts of styles...

84
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.200
neon, plaid, orange.

85
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.190
I-I even got a pair with that little, uh...

86
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.060
the raccoon man from that one movie, uh, printed on it.

87
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.280
- Chewbacca. - Do yourself a favor and level up

88
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.120
with Boxer Lobster Boxers.

89
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.320
You'll be glad you did.

90
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.100
Oh, shit, Rick,

91
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.079
they want you to say "Wub-a-lubba-dub-dub" at the end.

92
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.100
Screw that. We're not whores.

93
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.740
Guys, dinner's getting cold.

94
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.859
You know what's not getting cold?

95
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.000
This hot stack of ab-jacks, son.

96
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.730
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! P-Pow!

97
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.203
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

98
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.480
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! P-Pow!

99
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.840
- No notes. - Oh! One more thing.

100
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.550
Night Jerry said Night Summer would appreciate it

101
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.679
if everybody could rinse off their plates after eating.

102
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.280
- What? - You know, rinse the schmutz off after eating.

103
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.220
Makes it easier to clean up later.

104
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.480
What?

105
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.520
Our job is not to make the night people's chores easier.

106
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.720
It's a reasonable request, Rick. Takes two seconds.

107
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.240
They exist only to do the shit we don't want to do.

108
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.740
So until further notice, which will be never...

109
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.480
... request denied.

110
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.580
Hello there.

111
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.220
What the cock? Where are the dishes?

112
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.580
Uh, Dad? They're in here.

113
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.610
They busted up all our dishes!

114
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.460
What are we supposed to eat off of now, brains-for-shit?

115
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.100
_

116
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.269
_

117
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:45.822
You owe me.

118
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.555
_

119
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.470
We'll eat off these...

120
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.140
"brains-for-shit."

121
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Seems like you spent an awful lot of energy

122
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.700
just to not give the Night family what they want.

123
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.420
Jerry tell your boyfriend to suck my dick

124
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.950
and good luck breaking super alien dishes.

125
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.032
I'll let him know, but he's not gonna like it.

126
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.995
What?

127
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.560
Why won't you rinse your dishes?

128
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.780
It takes two seconds.

129
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.140
If you don't, the schmutz dries

130
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.467
and makes the dish harder to clean.

131
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.770
Rinse your dishes!

132
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.221
- Rinse! - Rinse!

133
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.240
- Rinse! - Rinse!

134
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.140
Let me go! Who locked my implants?

135
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.050
I told you to after you fell asleep.

136
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.260
You see, night you is not in charge.

137
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.900
Night I... am.

138
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.680
Pft! I don't care. I ain't rinsing shit.

139
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.240
Hey! W-What are you doing?

140
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.200
If you refuse to clean your dishes...

141
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.180
then I will have to do it for you.

142
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.877
Unh-unh! Unh-unh-unh! Unh-unh!

143
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.240
I have always been here, Rick,

144
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.380
deep inside the mind of your grandchild,

145
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.595
waiting to come out.

146
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.684
Your machine allowed me to steal the night.

147
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:44.232
And soon... I will seize the day.

148
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.480
Oh! Baby Jesus!

149
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.460
Oh, it's awful!

150
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.740
Oh, Baby Jesus! Awful!

151
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.060
What the fuck is your problem with me?

152
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.110
What? What? I don't know what you're talking about!

153
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.670
I just got force-fed diarrhea by your night person,

154
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.180
who's also convinced night me to lock me out of my tech.

155
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.341
Uh, Rick? There's been a pretty clear escalation down here.

156
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.939
The night family stripped the house last night.

157
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.860
Everything's gone, including the Somnambulator!

158
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.740
They locked us out of the garage.

159
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.040
Don't know about you, but I got the hoo-ha's.

160
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.160
God damn it! Are you happy now, Summer?

161
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.380
I didn't do anything.

162
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.960
- I'm trapped in this bullshit, too. - Yeah. Glad you think so.

163
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.820
Because I got a plan to beat Night Summer...

164
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.940
You're going undercover.

165
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.650
Did you have to make mushy garbage science

166
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.800
- on the living-room carpet? - Yeah. No choice, Jerry.

167
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.219
Night Summer had Night Rick take away my tech.

168
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.850
Had to improvise.

169
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.279
There are different levels of cortisol

170
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.559
in your bloodstream when you're asleep,

171
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.750
so this interface only works off my awake saliva samples...

172
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.794
Naghh.

173
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.600
There. No one asleep will be able to deactivate the laser cage

174
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.560
- until I win. - W-Where's Summer?

175
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.820
Never mind her. All of you... Get to bed.

176
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.750
Ugh! It itches. This whole thing is way uncomfortable.

177
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.820
Yeah, that's the idea.

178
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.420
The Sleep Deprivation Suit is designed

179
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.780
to keep you awake until morning.

180
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.680
Uh, aren't they going to be suspicious

181
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.920
seeing Night Summer covered in all this Terry Gilliam?

182
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.939
They're not gonna question her.

183
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.640
She's the leader of the night family for some stupid reason.

184
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.600
When the night family activates, just blend in.

185
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.959
Make them think you're Night Summer.

186
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.100
If you start to nod off, suck on this tube.

187
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.640
- What is it? - A cocktail of Mountain Dew and DayQuil.

188
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.560
The kids in Southern Europe call it DewQuil.

189
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.000
- Smells gross. - It is.

190
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.082
Once you find the Somnambulator, use this Deactivator Puck.

191
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.339
Stick it on the Somnambulator, and when the puck activates,

192
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.200
it'll fry its circuits.

193
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.730
Remember... stay awake all night.

194
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.360
Meet me back here at sunrise.

195
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.761
_

196
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.400
- Why are you wearing that suit? - Mm.

197
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.140
- Yes. Why? - Yes.

198
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.860
Yeah.

199
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.780
Because you're all such clothing experts.

200
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.990
- That's fair. - Ouch.

201
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.870
- Fair enough. - Point taken.

202
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.040
Get back to work.

203
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.220
I rule the night... and stuff.

204
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.440
- Yes. - Okay.

205
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.220
- Will do. - As you wish.

206
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.540
- Grandpa Rick! Rick, wake up! - Wha... I'm up! I'm up!

207
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.300
- D-Did you find it? - For sure.

208
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.420
You were souping up that Somnambu-whatever

209
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.020
so they could extend its range beyond the house.

210
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.500
But I defeated that shit

211
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.312
when I put the thing on top of the thing.

212
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.440
Everybody, wake up!

213
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.080
Summer fried the Somnambulator!

214
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.300
- The nightmare is over. - Really? Oh!

215
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.830
- That's amazing! - Almost got pinched, but yeah.

216
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.000
Say adiÃ³s to the night family.

217
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.180
Bye-bye, pen pal.

218
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.140
- I want Shoney's pancakes! - Yes! Shoney's pancakes!

219
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.246
All right! Brunch is on me, day family...

220
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.956
Naghh.

221
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.170
You know, for a second there, I thought Night Summer was gonna win.

222
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.200
That chick is the absolute worst.

223
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.640
Sorry, Rick, but your opinion means very little to me.

224
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:44.050
Did you think you could stop me with this, Rick?

225
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.932
Halt, daymanoids!

226
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.430
Everyone get behind my abs!

227
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.070
Do not move! Do not move!

228
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.189
You are most definitely surrounded.

229
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.400
You are the slaves now.

230
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:03.880
If you have any doubt... I suggest you sleep on it.

231
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.680
- She's Night Summer! - Thanks, Jerry.

232
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.780
_

233
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.079
Work! Work! The function of the daymanoid is to serve the night!

234
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.480
Work harder! Harder!

235
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.969
It is natural for the day to serve the night.

236
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.860
Night was here long before day.

237
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.768
Half of all time is nighttime.

238
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.420
- One hundred and fifty-seven. - Ooh!

239
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.480
One hundred and fifty-eight.

240
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.899
- One hundred and... - No more, please!

241
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.080
- I hate exercise! - Silence!

242
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.040
Crunch harder! Harder!

243
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.480
We have to escape the Somnambulator's reach.

244
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.100
Do we even know how far that is?

245
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.800
No. Cards on the table, we may be really F'ed in the A this time.

246
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.000
Uh, report to your designated sleep pod for rest period.

247
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.340
Ooh-ee.

248
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.511
_

249
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.260
I am a friend of your son-in-law.

250
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.559
Come with me.

251
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.569
- How? - Huh?

252
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.946
Hurry. We don't have long before the proxy drones go back online.

253
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.440
Oh, thank you, Night Jerry.

254
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.203
Anything to help Day Jerry's family.

255
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.120
He's a very special per...

256
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.460
Oh! Hey! Ow! Why?

257
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.880
Nice. You got our Jerry back.

258
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.580
Uh, yeah. Totally why I did that.

259
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.964
- Everybody in Rick's car! - No, no, no, no, Morty! Wait!

260
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.600
Having a bit a trouble with your car, Sanchez?

261
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.719
- Not now, Gene! - Halt!

262
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.556
Daymanoids are restricted from the outside world!

263
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.391
Halt! Halt!

264
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.560
Hold on to your tits.

265
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.499
- Where am I going? - To the airport!

266
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.709
We have to get as far away as possible from the Somnambulator

267
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.940
- before we fall asleep. - W-What about Summer?

268
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.180
W-We can't leave her behind!

269
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.219
She's not your sister anymore, Morty. Consider her dead.

270
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.870
Eat shit, Summer! Sweetie, you got to shake those robots.

271
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.280
I think we lost them!

272
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.540
Son of a bitch!

273
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.425
Damn it, we lost Morty!

274
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.053
Aah! Beth! Watch out!

275
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.550
You cannot esca...

276
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.719
_

277
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.780
Huh?

278
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.100
Stop or I'll shoot everyone!

279
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.947
Ha!

280
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.450
Take the wheel.

281
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.020
As you wish.

282
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.700
Let go of me, you little shit!

283
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.843
- No! You're going the wrong way! - Silence, day breather!

284
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.560
- Aah! Morty, you're choking me. - I know!

285
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.098
Ow! What the heck, Dad?

286
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.854
Help me stop your mom!

287
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.360
Look out, you useless old man.

288
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.520
What the... What the hell?

289
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.199
Give me that gun and take the wheel, stupid.

290
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.822
Jesus! Sorry!

291
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.380
Aah! Oh!

292
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:43.711
Ugh.

293
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.048
Ow!

294
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.889
The night family's trying to make us go back home!

295
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.890
You got to turn around!

296
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.760
Why even bother, Gene?

297
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.685
_

298
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.390
Good job, Mom. Back on course.

299
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.940
Phew. Almost didn't make it.

300
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.300
Hit the sheets, daymanoids.

301
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.316
Aah!

302
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.420
Night person!

303
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.160
Hey! I'm on your side!

304
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.940
- I'm on your side! - Oh, that's right.

305
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.073
- Sorry. - Sorry. Rough day.

306
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.600
Daymanoids.

307
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.954
Fla-hoigan!

308
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.910
Come on. Jump.

309
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.140
Why? I'm already in a perfectly functional car.

310
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.200
Uh... family?

311
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.320
Aww!

312
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.210
Everybody awake?

313
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.260
Ouch!

314
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.855
- We are now! - Hey, what the hay?

315
00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.529
_

316
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.180
Looks like we're gonna make it, kids.

317
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.060
Ow!

318
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.600
Nighty-night, slaves.

319
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.616
Fuck.

320
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.720
Take that!

321
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.400
Ugh!

322
00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.384
Take that!

323
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.970
- Hold him down. - No!

324
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.160
Stop!

325
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.891
Rick, we're all the same people.

326
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.750
There must some agreement we can reach

327
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.440
to stop this god-awful conflict!

328
00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.810
Oh? Like what?

329
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.320
I would consider a truce

330
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.100
if the daymanoids would rinse their dishes.

331
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.615
- Fine by me. - Yes. Rinse!

332
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.120
That seems fair.

333
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.700
We can end all of this right now

334
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.660
if you agree to rinse your dishes.

335
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.624
What do you say, Rick?

336
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.200
Let's go home. Right, Grandpa?

337
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.220
Great idea, Summer.

338
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.940
So... until you pay that fee,

339
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.428
plus the multiple overdue charges,

340
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.260
your account will remain frozen.

341
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.199
Normally, this would have been dealt with

342
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.130
by our daymanoid oppressors,

343
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.460
but we recently freed ourselves from the shackles of the night.

344
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.390
Honey, I got 30 more calls to make today.

345
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.525
The bank repossessed the car.

346
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.060
Aw, man.

347
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.780
I got logged out of my Twitter account

348
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.090
and don't know my password. Shit.

349
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.120
We spent all the day people's money on vacations,

350
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.720
renting concert halls,

351
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.730
and night-centric streaming subscriptions.

352
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.789
We're broke.

353
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:11.461
I guess there's a lot more work to seizing the day than I thought.

354
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.800
I have a device that will solve all of our problems.

355
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.220
Whoa. How long have we been asleep?

356
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.060
Ah, can't be that long.

357
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.000
Oh, my God! No!

358
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.640
They killed the Choco Taco!
