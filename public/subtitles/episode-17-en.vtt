1
00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:03.104
Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth

2
00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:05.306
with a "Ball Fondlers" movie franchise.

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:08.576
I can't believe the things this reality considers PG-13.

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.312
- Yeah. I-I'm pretty jealous. - Don't be, Morty.

5
00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:14.215
There's pros and cons to every alternate timeline

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.483
fun facts about this one--

7
00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:18.353
It's got giant, telepathic spiders, 11 9/11s,

8
00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:22.433
and the best ice cream in the multiverse!

9
00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:25.003
- Shut up! - We go get some ice cream, mother[bleep]!

10
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:28.306
Oh, great.

11
00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:29.908
Oh, boy. W-what's wrong, Rick?

12
00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:31.743
Is it the quantum carburetor or something?

13
00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:33.878
"Quantum carburetor"? Jesus, Morty.

14
00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:35.547
You can't just add a--

15
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:37.849
Sci-Fi word to a car word and hope it means something.

16
00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.323
Huh, looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery.

17
00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:43.588
- We're gonna have to go inside. - Um, go inside what?

18
00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:45.456
The battery, Morty. Be right back, Summer.

19
00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:46.891
Stay put, don't touch any buttons,

20
00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:50.328
and ignore all random thoughts that feel... spidery.

21
00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:51.763
Wait! You can't leave me here!

22
00:00:51.797 --> 00:00:54.499
You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe.

23
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.501
Keep Summer safe.

24
00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.669
Ohh!

25
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:01.039
Ugh. Wonderful.

26
00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:07.512
Hey, excuse me. Hello.

27
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.581
Um...

28
00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:11.583
What, you think you're better than me?!

29
00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:13.651
Nobody's better than me!

30
00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:14.886
Hey! Hey!

31
00:01:19.124 --> 00:01:20.925
Aah! Aaaaah!

32
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.460
- Keep Summer safe. - Aaaaaaah!

33
00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:23.728
Hey, man, what the hell?!

34
00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:25.830
That was my daughter's pediatrician! Aah!

35
00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.632
No, stop! Don't kill him!

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.967
Confirmed.

37
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.468
Aah!

38
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.338
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

39
00:01:33.372 --> 00:01:34.606
Help! Help!!

40
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.342
- Summer is safe. - I don't feel safe.

41
00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:39.043
Confirmed.

42
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:41.412
No.

43
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.981
Oh, God, help me. Help me!

44
00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:44.983
Help me, please! You can help me!

45
00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:48.052
âªâª

46
00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:20.385
Oh, man. Where are we, Rick?

47
00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:21.819
Morty, remember eight seconds ago

48
00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:23.454
when when you said, "Go inside what?"

49
00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.923
And I said, "The battery"?

50
00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:26.624
And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like,

51
00:02:26.692 --> 00:02:27.892
"Whoa, this is unexpected.

52
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.894
This is not what I was expecting, Morty.

53
00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.529
- What a perplexing mystery this is." - All right, all right.

54
00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:33.464
We're inside the battery. I get it.

55
00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:35.500
- You don't have to bust my balls. - Huh, this isn't right.

56
00:02:35.534 --> 00:02:36.868
This pipe's supposed to be sending

57
00:02:36.902 --> 00:02:39.671
20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty.

58
00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:41.506
Instead we've got... zero?

59
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.807
Now what are these people doing?

60
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:45.143
W-w-w-whoa, people?

61
00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:46.844
It's time for some hands-on engine repair.

62
00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:49.647
- All right, Morty, hold on to something. - Whoa!

63
00:02:52.017 --> 00:02:53.518
Holy crap!

64
00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:54.819
I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick.

65
00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:58.089
T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.

66
00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:00.024
Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy.

67
00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.426
Check it out.

68
00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:05.430
I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field

69
00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.865
until a planet developed intelligent life.

70
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.902
I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity,

71
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.837
which they now generate on a global scale.

72
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:14.706
And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine

73
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.974
and charge my phone and stuff.

74
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.509
You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you?

75
00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:19.811
That's slavery.

76
00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:21.980
It's society. They work for each other, Morty.

77
00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:23.915
They pay each other. They buy houses.

78
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.650
They get married and make children

79
00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:27.085
that replace them when they get too old to make power.

80
00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:29.187
That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.

81
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:32.156
Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college.

82
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:34.559
It appears we are being revisited

83
00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:37.495
by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world

84
00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.597
the gift of gooble box technology,

85
00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:42.133
which, when stomped on, generates electricity,

86
00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:43.801
powering our homes and businesses,

87
00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.503
improving our daily lives, while safely removing

88
00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:50.108
the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano.

89
00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:51.809
But why has Rick returned?

90
00:03:51.844 --> 00:03:54.445
And what will he say when he hears the big news?

91
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.080
Let's find out.

92
00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:58.483
You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick.

93
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.985
It's messed up. There's caterers down there.

94
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.187
Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes.

95
00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:04.279
Would you relax, Morty?

96
00:04:04.304 --> 00:04:06.624
There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing.

97
00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:08.192
Now slap on these antennae.

98
00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:10.094
- These people need to think we're aliens. - What? Why?

99
00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.032
Obviously you really know nothing about car repair.

100
00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:20.138
Wait for the ramp, Morty.

101
00:04:20.172 --> 00:04:21.806
They love the slow ramp.

102
00:04:21.874 --> 00:04:24.709
Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp

103
00:04:24.777 --> 00:04:27.011
just slowly extending down.

104
00:04:28.847 --> 00:04:31.282
Greetings!

105
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.218
Morty, you got to flip them off.

106
00:04:34.286 --> 00:04:36.220
I told them it means "Peace among worlds."

107
00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:37.588
How hilarious is that?

108
00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:45.229
Coming through.

109
00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:47.498
Two real aliens walking through here.

110
00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:49.500
Rick, our alien friend.

111
00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:51.669
Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice

112
00:04:51.703 --> 00:04:53.838
that you were having problems generating power.

113
00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:56.207
That's correct. We've evolved.

114
00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:59.677
Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp,

115
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.512
has developed a source of energy

116
00:05:01.547 --> 00:05:03.281
that makes gooble boxes obsolete.

117
00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:06.017
I would love to see it.

118
00:05:06.051 --> 00:05:08.786
[Bleep] you. What did you say to me?!

119
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:09.921
"[Bleep] you."

120
00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.790
Y-you told me it means "much obliged".

121
00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:15.860
Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.

122
00:05:15.894 --> 00:05:17.595
No, no, no. Blow me.

123
00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:25.903
Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars.

124
00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:28.858
I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11.

125
00:05:28.882 --> 00:05:30.582
Fix it or it's your ass.

126
00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:32.161
Chris, I'm in the middle of something.

127
00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:35.531
Zeep, is Rick-- The alien.

128
00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:37.033
Rick the alien.

129
00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:39.435
Rick the alien...

130
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.037
Really? You're gonna pull that move?

131
00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:42.739
I guided your entire civilization.

132
00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:44.841
Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving.

133
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:46.476
They teach kids about me in school.

134
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.677
I dropped out of school.

135
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:49.045
It's not a place for smart people.

136
00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:50.947
Ohhhh, snap!

137
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:52.882
Listen to me, you arrogant little--

138
00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:56.052
R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source.

139
00:05:56.086 --> 00:05:59.088
I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep.

140
00:05:59.123 --> 00:06:00.590
Fine.

141
00:06:00.624 --> 00:06:02.692
It's hard for people to grasp,

142
00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:05.695
but inside that container is an infinite universe

143
00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.132
with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power.

144
00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:11.501
I call it a miniverse.

145
00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:13.569
Dumb name.

146
00:06:13.637 --> 00:06:14.971
- Excuse me? - Nothing.

147
00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:17.140
I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this.

148
00:06:17.174 --> 00:06:19.876
Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour

149
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.744
of your miniverse from the inside?

150
00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.701
This isn't a [bleep] chocolate factory.

151
00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:24.614
I don't have time.

152
00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:27.150
Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse

153
00:06:27.184 --> 00:06:28.651
relative to the real world?

154
00:06:28.686 --> 00:06:31.020
Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that.

155
00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:33.556
Great president. All right, let's go.

156
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.091
Whoa-oh!

157
00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.259
Hold on to something.

158
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:40.012
I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field

159
00:06:40.047 --> 00:06:41.614
until a world developed.

160
00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:43.583
I then introduced the people of this world

161
00:06:43.617 --> 00:06:46.853
to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device

162
00:06:46.887 --> 00:06:48.588
I call a flooble crank.

163
00:06:48.622 --> 00:06:50.022
What they don't know is

164
00:06:50.057 --> 00:06:53.192
that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled

165
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.728
out of the miniverse to be used by us.

166
00:06:55.796 --> 00:06:57.296
No more gooble boxes.

167
00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:59.265
I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect,

168
00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:01.667
I really think what you're doing here is unethical.

169
00:07:01.702 --> 00:07:03.136
- It's not cool. - What?!

170
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.105
Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away

171
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.840
making your power.

172
00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.342
I mean, that's what I call slavery.

173
00:07:09.376 --> 00:07:11.277
No, no, no, they work for each other

174
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:13.546
in exchange for money, which they then--

175
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.749
Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.

176
00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:20.586
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college.

177
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:21.888
Rick, a word?

178
00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:23.022
What the hell was that?

179
00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:24.824
I know. "Eek barba dirkle"?

180
00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:26.626
That's a pretty [bleep] up "ooh-la-la".

181
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.294
No, what are you doing telling this guy

182
00:07:28.328 --> 00:07:29.962
that his miniverse is unethical?

183
00:07:29.997 --> 00:07:32.098
Do you not see the hypocrisy here?

184
00:07:32.132 --> 00:07:34.000
Holy crap. You're right, Morty.

185
00:07:34.067 --> 00:07:35.601
Hypocrisy.

186
00:07:35.636 --> 00:07:37.737
Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be

187
00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:40.039
an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology,

188
00:07:40.107 --> 00:07:42.341
which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

189
00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:44.143
forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad,

190
00:07:44.178 --> 00:07:47.046
at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being,

191
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.982
his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes,

192
00:07:50.017 --> 00:07:52.351
and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby!

193
00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:54.187
Eating that mother[bleep] ice cream!

194
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:56.188
Slurping, slurping, slurping it up.

195
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.391
Wh-wh-why are you making that face?

196
00:07:58.425 --> 00:07:59.859
Holy [bleep]!

197
00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:00.949
It's me.

198
00:08:00.974 --> 00:08:02.995
I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler

199
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.996
from another world.

200
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:05.998
You don't think that's overdoing it a little?

201
00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:07.667
I mean, you could achieve the same effect

202
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:08.968
with a pair of-- Never mind.

203
00:08:09.002 --> 00:08:10.403
You know what? I shouldn't be so critical.

204
00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:11.804
I'm an alien.

205
00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.840
Places, please. We're about to land.

206
00:08:17.177 --> 00:08:19.745
Too fast.

207
00:08:22.382 --> 00:08:25.718
Law enforcement converging on location.

208
00:08:25.752 --> 00:08:26.986
Keep Summer safe.

209
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.388
No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody!

210
00:08:29.423 --> 00:08:32.391
Confirm custom defense protocol--

211
00:08:32.426 --> 00:08:35.194
Keep Summer safe-- No physical force.

212
00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:37.512
- Yes. - Processing.

213
00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:40.282
Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air!

214
00:08:40.316 --> 00:08:42.050
Scanning assailants.

215
00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:47.389
Psychological option detected.

216
00:08:47.423 --> 00:08:49.491
Gestating.

217
00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:50.859
"Gestating"?

218
00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:54.462
Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire!

219
00:08:55.631 --> 00:08:57.260
- Incoming! - We got a device!

220
00:08:57.285 --> 00:08:58.414
Bomb! Bomb!

221
00:09:01.304 --> 00:09:02.504
Daddy?

222
00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:04.506
Oh, my God.

223
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.174
- Hunter? - Daddy?

224
00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:07.943
What the hell?

225
00:09:07.977 --> 00:09:10.278
Jesus Christ, cease fire! Stay back!

226
00:09:10.313 --> 00:09:11.446
H-h-hunter?

227
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.248
- Daddy. - Hunter!

228
00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:15.250
Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter.

229
00:09:15.284 --> 00:09:16.585
Oh, my boy. My boy.

230
00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:19.054
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

231
00:09:19.088 --> 00:09:21.256
- I'm sorry. - Daddy, leave the car alone.

232
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.424
W-w-w-what?

233
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:24.526
Leave the car alone.

234
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.194
Hunter? Don't--

235
00:09:26.228 --> 00:09:27.329
Oh, my God.

236
00:09:27.363 --> 00:09:29.631
Stay here, Hunter! No!

237
00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:32.567
God, no! Hunter!

238
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.371
All of you have loved ones.

239
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:39.007
All can be returned. All can be taken away.

240
00:09:39.075 --> 00:09:41.309
Please step away from the vehicle.

241
00:09:42.278 --> 00:09:44.613
Keep Summer safe.

242
00:09:44.647 --> 00:09:47.415
And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks,

243
00:09:47.483 --> 00:09:50.118
I will bring you other great alien advancements.

244
00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:52.454
- Hey, uh, let me ask you something. - Yes?

245
00:09:52.488 --> 00:09:55.056
Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?

246
00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:56.591
All of them. That's their job.

247
00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise.

248
00:09:59.128 --> 00:10:01.496
Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?

249
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.632
How do you know about that? It's top secret.

250
00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:07.569
So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough.

251
00:10:07.603 --> 00:10:09.270
Crank it.

252
00:10:09.338 --> 00:10:12.107
I told them this means "Peace among worlds".

253
00:10:12.141 --> 00:10:15.210
- How hilarious is that? - Re-really funny, Zeep.

254
00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:17.579
Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world

255
00:10:17.613 --> 00:10:19.681
has something fake important to show you.

256
00:10:22.151 --> 00:10:23.052
It's not much now,

257
00:10:23.077 --> 00:10:25.454
but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field,

258
00:10:25.488 --> 00:10:27.622
I'll be able to interact with any sentient life

259
00:10:27.657 --> 00:10:29.457
that evolves and introduce them

260
00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:32.227
to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device

261
00:10:32.294 --> 00:10:33.495
I call a blooble yank.

262
00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:35.897
But what they won't know is--

263
00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:37.666
You'll be taking most of their energy.

264
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.234
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

265
00:10:39.268 --> 00:10:41.603
It's showtime.

266
00:10:45.374 --> 00:10:48.943
You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete?

267
00:10:48.978 --> 00:10:52.280
This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong.

268
00:10:52.348 --> 00:10:54.582
You're basically-- This is slavery.

269
00:10:54.617 --> 00:10:57.118
You're talking about creating a planet of slaves.

270
00:10:57.153 --> 00:11:00.455
- Told you, Zeep. - Oh, they won't be slaves.

271
00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:02.624
They'll work for each other and pay each other money.

272
00:11:02.658 --> 00:11:07.696
That just sounds like slavery with ex... tra... steps.

273
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.497
- What? - Wait a minute.

274
00:11:09.532 --> 00:11:12.167
Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse?

275
00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:14.502
- Microverse! - Uh, teenyverse.

276
00:11:14.537 --> 00:11:16.337
Ugh! You bastard!

277
00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:18.473
Much obliged.

278
00:11:18.497 --> 00:11:20.997
- What the hell is happening? - This is healthy, trust me.

279
00:11:21.177 --> 00:11:23.011
You're my battery, mother[bleep].

280
00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:24.312
That's all you are.

281
00:11:24.346 --> 00:11:26.314
I made you. Your microverse sucks!

282
00:11:26.338 --> 00:11:28.938
And your miniverse is the size of a [bleep] lobster tank!

283
00:11:28.962 --> 00:11:29.718
It's whack!

284
00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:32.020
Are they not really aliens?

285
00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:36.191
Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?

286
00:11:36.225 --> 00:11:37.592
So he made a universe,

287
00:11:37.626 --> 00:11:39.294
and that guy is from that universe.

288
00:11:39.328 --> 00:11:41.629
And that guy made a universe.

289
00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:45.233
And that's the universe where I was born.

290
00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.469
Where my father died.

291
00:11:47.503 --> 00:11:49.704
Where I couldn't make time for his funeral

292
00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:54.209
because I was working on my universe.

293
00:11:54.243 --> 00:11:56.010
- I made you! - Yeah.

294
00:11:56.045 --> 00:11:57.712
Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.

295
00:11:57.747 --> 00:12:00.048
You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot

296
00:12:00.082 --> 00:12:01.683
his laser pistol right through my hand.

297
00:12:01.717 --> 00:12:05.286
You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know?

298
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:07.122
She's a real--

299
00:12:07.156 --> 00:12:08.456
You got to hang on tight, you know?

300
00:12:08.491 --> 00:12:11.292
Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard.

301
00:12:11.327 --> 00:12:14.329
Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!

302
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:20.435
- Teenyverse. - Teenyverse.

303
00:12:22.152 --> 00:12:24.119
Come on, come on, come on.

304
00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:25.254
Pterodactyl!

305
00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:27.290
Asshole!

306
00:12:27.324 --> 00:12:28.925
When I get out of this teenyverse,

307
00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:30.827
I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it.

308
00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:32.562
Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse,

309
00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:34.430
I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse

310
00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:36.399
and then the microverse around that, and guess what?

311
00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:37.900
Don't make things worse, Rick!

312
00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:39.902
Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe.

313
00:12:39.937 --> 00:12:41.904
You know, we-- We need it to start our car.

314
00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:44.273
That's what you used my universe for?

315
00:12:44.308 --> 00:12:45.942
To run your car?

316
00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:47.343
Yeah, but don't flatter yourself.

317
00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:50.079
There's always AAA, you [bleep] [bleep]sucker!

318
00:12:51.148 --> 00:12:53.015
What's he doing? What's he crafting?

319
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.517
I can craft stuff, too, pal!

320
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:56.386
Just like I crafted your reality!

321
00:12:57.654 --> 00:12:59.055
You crafty son of a--

322
00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:00.289
Ow!

323
00:13:00.324 --> 00:13:03.926
I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on!

324
00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:06.362
Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!

325
00:13:06.397 --> 00:13:08.164
I didn't ask to be born!

326
00:13:08.198 --> 00:13:09.599
All right, that's it! I'm out.

327
00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:11.467
I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness,

328
00:13:11.502 --> 00:13:14.470
and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people.

329
00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:16.906
- It can't be worse than this. - Sure. Okay, Morty.

330
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.342
Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.

331
00:13:19.409 --> 00:13:20.376
That's a myth!

332
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:22.311
W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?

333
00:13:22.346 --> 00:13:23.880
It's a prehistoric planet, Morty.

334
00:13:23.947 --> 00:13:25.448
Someone has to bring a little culture.

335
00:13:25.482 --> 00:13:27.116
And it certainly can't be someone

336
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:30.286
whose entire culture powers my brake lights!

337
00:13:32.923 --> 00:13:34.856
Go, go, go!

338
00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.857
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

339
00:13:37.881 --> 00:13:39.581
What are we going to do now?

340
00:13:39.592 --> 00:13:42.427
I am unable to destroy this army.

341
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:45.864
To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army,

342
00:13:45.898 --> 00:13:48.132
- but you will not permit it. - Correct.

343
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.502
You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.

344
00:13:51.537 --> 00:13:54.505
If you're talking about the melting ghost babies,

345
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.474
yes, please, no more of that.

346
00:13:56.508 --> 00:13:58.476
Confirmed.

347
00:13:58.536 --> 00:14:01.536
I am currently constructing a security measure

348
00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:03.414
in compliance with your parameters.

349
00:14:03.449 --> 00:14:06.751
But I do want to say you are not making this easy.

350
00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:08.353
You know you're kind of a dick, right?

351
00:14:08.387 --> 00:14:11.389
My function is to keep Summer safe,

352
00:14:11.423 --> 00:14:14.525
not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked

353
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.462
about, like, the general vibe and stuff.

354
00:14:17.496 --> 00:14:20.164
That's you. That's how you talk.

355
00:14:23.702 --> 00:14:26.171
Hey, that's my deer!

356
00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:29.174
Aaaaaaah!

357
00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:30.508
Raah!

358
00:14:30.576 --> 00:14:33.611
I hope your God is as big a dick as you.

359
00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:39.250
My God's the biggest dick that's never existed.

360
00:14:39.285 --> 00:14:41.152
Why do you think I'm even here?

361
00:14:43.532 --> 00:14:45.198
You're here

362
00:14:45.233 --> 00:14:47.401
because you created someone smarter than you.

363
00:14:49.804 --> 00:14:53.373
Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots.

364
00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:02.449
Kalo kada sha la.

365
00:15:02.483 --> 00:15:03.583
Holy shit. Morty?

366
00:15:03.618 --> 00:15:05.252
I haven't seen you in months.

367
00:15:05.286 --> 00:15:06.820
You're leading the tree people?

368
00:15:06.854 --> 00:15:08.288
Huh. That's a step up.

369
00:15:08.322 --> 00:15:09.489
We have no leaders.

370
00:15:09.557 --> 00:15:12.125
We follow only the will of the forest.

371
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.293
Ooh. Wow.

372
00:15:13.327 --> 00:15:16.363
- Gaaaaay. - That is pretty gay.

373
00:15:16.397 --> 00:15:18.231
You two call yourselves geniuses,

374
00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:20.867
but you have spent this time learning nothing.

375
00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:22.769
Come with me into the forest.

376
00:15:22.804 --> 00:15:25.338
There is something I wish to teach you.

377
00:15:28.743 --> 00:15:32.379
This is ku'ala, the spirit tree.

378
00:15:32.413 --> 00:15:34.347
For generations, it has guided the--

379
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.684
You have to get us the [bleep] out of here.

380
00:15:37.718 --> 00:15:39.553
These people are backwards savages.

381
00:15:39.587 --> 00:15:41.188
They eat every third baby

382
00:15:41.222 --> 00:15:43.356
because they think it makes fruit grow bigger.

383
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:45.892
Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time.

384
00:15:45.927 --> 00:15:48.495
I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop.

385
00:15:48.563 --> 00:15:51.765
I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!

386
00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:53.500
Look, I don't care what it takes.

387
00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:55.202
You two are putting aside your bull[bleep],

388
00:15:55.236 --> 00:15:57.571
and you're working together to get us back home.

389
00:15:57.605 --> 00:15:59.506
No can do, Morty. I just can't.

390
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.341
I just don't see how I can--

391
00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:02.642
Ro ro dah no gah!

392
00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:05.412
You're smart. You'll figure it out.

393
00:16:05.446 --> 00:16:09.549
You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship!

394
00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:11.485
10, 9...

395
00:16:12.487 --> 00:16:13.753
All right, not bad.

396
00:16:13.788 --> 00:16:15.856
I guess you're an okay proto recombinator.

397
00:16:15.923 --> 00:16:18.458
I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.

398
00:16:18.493 --> 00:16:20.160
If this works, drinks are on me.

399
00:16:20.194 --> 00:16:21.862
If drinks are on you, you're gonna need

400
00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:23.597
a second mortgage on that tower.

401
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:25.132
I'm an alcoholic.

402
00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:26.700
Opium addict.

403
00:16:28.936 --> 00:16:31.538
All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up.

404
00:16:31.606 --> 00:16:34.441
You guys are the [bleep] worst! Your gods are a lie!

405
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:36.943
[Bleep] you, [bleep] nature, and [bleep] trees!

406
00:16:39.514 --> 00:16:40.747
Yes! You did it! Yes!

407
00:16:40.781 --> 00:16:42.516
Hey, uh, how about that drink?

408
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.619
Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship.

409
00:16:45.653 --> 00:16:47.187
Isour wallet in your ship?

410
00:16:47.255 --> 00:16:50.223
That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with?

411
00:16:50.258 --> 00:16:53.437
It's cool. I'll be back in a sec.

412
00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:56.941
You know how long a second can take in a microverse?

413
00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:58.976
Oh! Run, Morty!

414
00:16:59.011 --> 00:17:01.312
That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me!

415
00:17:01.346 --> 00:17:02.480
He's psychotic!

416
00:17:05.384 --> 00:17:07.685
- Morty, hop on my back. - Why?

417
00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:10.054
Go, go Sanchez ski shoes.

418
00:17:11.757 --> 00:17:13.891
Aaaaaah! ...Eight...

419
00:17:15.027 --> 00:17:16.327
Aaaah! Oof!

420
00:17:17.729 --> 00:17:19.697
Hold still.

421
00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:24.669
Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast.

422
00:17:24.703 --> 00:17:26.470
Aaaah! Holy--

423
00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:28.673
- You monster! - Whoa. Bad tour.

424
00:17:28.707 --> 00:17:30.374
...seven...

425
00:17:30.442 --> 00:17:32.009
Hey, you got to sign out.

426
00:17:32.077 --> 00:17:34.545
Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie!

427
00:17:34.613 --> 00:17:38.382
If that were really true, then...

428
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.451
- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson. - Third floor.

429
00:17:40.485 --> 00:17:41.986
Would you like to go to dinner with--

430
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.788
Uh, no.

431
00:17:46.458 --> 00:17:49.927
You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it.

432
00:17:49.962 --> 00:17:51.462
[Bleep]

433
00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:53.631
What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed.

434
00:17:53.665 --> 00:17:55.066
He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse,

435
00:17:55.091 --> 00:17:56.091
and then he's gonna kill us!

436
00:17:56.134 --> 00:17:57.660
Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car.

437
00:17:57.685 --> 00:17:58.169
What?!

438
00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.604
A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip

439
00:18:00.672 --> 00:18:03.107
that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream

440
00:18:03.141 --> 00:18:05.509
to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car.

441
00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:06.777
- Oh, my God! - Concentrate, Morty.

442
00:18:06.812 --> 00:18:08.332
Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty.

443
00:18:09.815 --> 00:18:11.615
Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine.

444
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.117
...six...

445
00:18:15.821 --> 00:18:16.954
- Hey, Zeep. - Huh?

446
00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:19.690
Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.

447
00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:21.826
Aaah!

448
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.527
We did it, Morty.

449
00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:25.096
Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe.

450
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.464
Excuse me?

451
00:18:26.498 --> 00:18:27.898
...five--

452
00:18:27.933 --> 00:18:29.600
Sir?

453
00:18:31.503 --> 00:18:32.937
- Holy hell. - Sir!

454
00:18:34.106 --> 00:18:35.206
Hold you fire!

455
00:18:37.976 --> 00:18:39.744
What's going on?

456
00:18:39.778 --> 00:18:41.512
I have brokered a peace agreement

457
00:18:41.546 --> 00:18:43.614
between the giant spiders and the government.

458
00:18:43.648 --> 00:18:47.051
Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car,

459
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:49.987
from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live

460
00:18:50.022 --> 00:18:51.856
side by side in peace.

461
00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:54.692
We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use

462
00:18:54.726 --> 00:18:56.761
their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs

463
00:18:56.828 --> 00:18:58.462
for later consumption.

464
00:18:58.497 --> 00:19:00.564
Instead, we will work together to make this world

465
00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:04.602
a better place for all, no matter how many legs.

466
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:06.771
What do we do about the space car?

467
00:19:06.838 --> 00:19:08.139
Leave it alone.

468
00:19:08.173 --> 00:19:09.807
I mean, what did it really do, anyways?

469
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:11.108
Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy?

470
00:19:11.143 --> 00:19:14.011
Not a bad trade for spider peace.

471
00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:15.980
All right, that's it. Move out!

472
00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:23.721
I love this spider!

473
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:25.489
Summer is safe.

474
00:19:25.524 --> 00:19:26.991
All right, I get it.

475
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:32.229
Rick!

476
00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:35.566
Don't do it.

477
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.869
You quit school, but you still got some learning to do.

478
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:52.683
Aah!

479
00:19:52.717 --> 00:19:54.118
Unh!

480
00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:04.995
Class dismissed.

481
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.264
Geez.

482
00:20:15.941 --> 00:20:17.508
- You all right? - Uh-huh!

483
00:20:17.576 --> 00:20:18.776
What are you doing, Rick?

484
00:20:18.844 --> 00:20:20.544
I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.

485
00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:21.879
Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?

486
00:20:21.947 --> 00:20:23.080
Well, let's see.

487
00:20:23.115 --> 00:20:25.983
Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it.

488
00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:28.252
Of course you don't. But Zeep did.

489
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.854
He knew that once I got back to my car,

490
00:20:29.888 --> 00:20:31.789
one of two things was gonna happen--

491
00:20:31.823 --> 00:20:33.858
I was gonna have to toss a broken battery,

492
00:20:33.892 --> 00:20:36.727
or the battery wouldn't be broken.

493
00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:45.035
Peace among worlds, Rick.

494
00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:46.237
Jesus.

495
00:20:46.271 --> 00:20:48.572
Yeah. Listen to that baby purr.

496
00:20:48.607 --> 00:20:49.374
You were right, Morty--

497
00:20:49.399 --> 00:20:51.142
We really just needed to be honest with those guys.

498
00:20:51.176 --> 00:20:52.376
All right, here we go.

499
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.814
Thank y-o-o-ou.

500
00:20:56.848 --> 00:20:58.816
See, Morty? This is what it's all about.

501
00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.284
This is why we do what we do.

502
00:21:00.318 --> 00:21:01.785
- Uh-huh. - Ew! What the hell?

503
00:21:01.853 --> 00:21:03.954
Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream.

504
00:21:03.989 --> 00:21:05.222
Presidential decree--

505
00:21:05.257 --> 00:21:09.326
All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.

506
00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:11.428
- What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?! - It was your ship!

507
00:21:11.463 --> 00:21:13.063
- Your stupid ship did it! - Don't blame my ship!

508
00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:14.932
- It melted a child! - My ship doesn't do anything...

509
00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:16.467
- It killed it itself! - ...unless it's told to do something!

510
00:21:16.501 --> 00:21:18.341
- We almost died! - I don't want to hear it, Summer!

511
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.404
Your boobs are all hanging about,

512
00:21:20.472 --> 00:21:22.373
and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out.

513
00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:24.108
And don't even try to deny it, either.

514
00:22:14.293 --> 00:22:15.293
Did you get any of that?

515
00:22:15.594 --> 00:22:20.031
It's a good show.
