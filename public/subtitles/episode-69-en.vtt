00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.594
Magnesium-J. Hydrogen-F. Father.

2
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.014
I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.

3
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.680
Very well. Your exile ends today.

4
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.510
Welcome home, Water-T.

5
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.440
The Numbericons! They're attacking!

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.529
Battle stations!

7
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.624
Divide and conquer! Zero survivors!

8
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.860
Aah!

9
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.799
- Father! - Son... take this thing.

10
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.801
It's a prophecy or some shit.

11
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.170
I'm dying.

12
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.888
Peace.

13
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.580
Water-T, where are you going?

14
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.040
There's too many of them.

15
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.732
Then I better crunch the numbers.

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.026
Aah!

17
00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:09.030
_

18
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.000
âª When your heart adds up âª

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.290
âª One plus one makes youuuuuuuu âª

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.830
âª Yeah âª

21
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.457
âª Alll right âª

22
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.087
He's too dope! Retreat!

23
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.256
âª Oh, yeah âª

24
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.467
âª We don't care about numbers âª

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.360
Oh, shit! He's crunching the numbers.

26
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.120
I thought he was talking about taxes,

27
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.597
but he's crunching us.

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.182
I'ma deduct your ass.

29
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.180
Aah!

30
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.105
They activated the Brackets Shield. We can't pull up.

31
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.120
Somebody kiss me.

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.160
I don't want to die not knowing love! No!

33
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170
âª Oooooh, yeah âª

34
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.720
âª Oh, yeah âª

35
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.720
âª We don't care about numbers âª

36
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.300
Sorry I'm late. I had to go pee.

37
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.640
Yo, what do you know about this?

38
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.010
The "I" of Harmony.

39
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.520
It holds some secret power,

40
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.128
but it's in a language nobody can read.

41
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.280
You don't gotta read shit, Lithium-P.

42
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.880
- It's math. - Careful, T.

43
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.009
They won't like that kind of number talk at the palace.

44
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.261
We're not going to the palace. We're going to Earth.

45
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.700
Why? You know a math expert there?

46
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.266
Unfortunately, I do.

47
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.160
In conclusion, without math

48
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.620
planes wouldn't fly and elephants would forget.

49
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.859
What is that sound?

50
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.000
Who is using air buds

51
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.026
- to listen to rap music? - Sorry, Mr. Goldenfold.

52
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.670
Detention! Class dismissed early

53
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.613
so Morty can have instant detention.

54
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.639
- Aw, no! - Are you serious?

55
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.749
- I want to learn! - I want to add and stuff.

56
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.400
Geez, Mr. Goldenfold, it's just a little hip hop.

57
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.786
It helps me concentrate.

58
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.100
Rap will never help anyone do anything.

59
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.710
Some things never change.

60
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.749
Ice-T?

61
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.360
Hey! Ice-T, it's me, Morty.

62
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.421
Remember me? "G-Get Schwifty"?

63
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.040
- No. - Aw.

64
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.000
And it's Water-T now.

65
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.820
I don't give an ass if you're Smokey Robinson.

66
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.460
You got the balls of a clown coming back to this school

67
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.972
without the homework you owe me.

68
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.380
Fuck your homework, old man.

69
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.850
My planet's at stake.

70
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.060
Mr. Goldenfold, you taught Ice-T math?

71
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.380
I tried, Morty.

72
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.620
I sure the hell tried.

73
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.960
Without math, Russia would control all Rubik's Cubes.

74
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.111
- Any questions? - Just one.

75
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.800
Who gives a fuck?

76
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.800
I am a knight, walking,

77
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.160
back of class talking, homework scoffing,

78
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.320
blackboard chalking...

79
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.160
Look, man, I ain't here for memory lane shit.

80
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.580
I need this deciphered.

81
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.650
Hmm. Early Algebraic, possibly even Geometric.

82
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.000
- Yo, English. - I don't teach English, bitch!

83
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.640
And why would I do your homework?

84
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.040
- You didn't do mine. - 'Cause I had no home!

85
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.095
Now I do.

86
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.020
Help me save it.

87
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.851
Aah!

88
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.480
All Type Strikers, attack!

89
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.600
Kill the Son of Magma-Q!

90
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.025
I want his serifs.

91
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.020
You're coming with me, Goldenfold.

92
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.880
You better be taking me to your homework.

93
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.470
- You're coming with me, Morty. - Why?

94
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.460
It's called detention, not "releastion."

95
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.550
Sorry I'm late. I had to go pee.

96
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.009
- I know. - Well, there's new people.

97
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.399
- I thought they'd like to hear about it. - Yeah, yeah.

98
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.839
Just start the fucking ship.

99
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.700
I see the tales of your dopeness

100
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.840
have been greatly exaggerated.

101
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.974
Big talk from an upside down L.

102
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.562
I am Sinistar-7, and I am here to spill the T.

103
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.481
Then come get me, muthafucka!

104
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.000
She's got a Caps Lock!

105
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.500
And an ass to suck.

106
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.702
Hit the hyphen drive!

107
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.787
_

108
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.160
No. No!

109
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.130
- Speak. - Lord Dread Nought.

110
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.370
Water-T escaped with the "I" of Harmony.

111
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.750
- Aah! - The One of Harmony!

112
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.470
That's gotta hurt!

113
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.559
You're a number. Act like it.

114
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.272
Subtract Water-T from life and carry the One to me.

115
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.816
I won't let you down... Father.

116
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.460
- Too late. - Too late!

117
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.840
Oh! Oh, wow. Oh, I love my job.

118
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.880
The Pythagorean Theorem! I just have to figure out

119
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.240
what A and B are, square them both,

120
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.960
and then add them together.

121
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.900
- Can you do it? - If I do,

122
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.334
- I want my homework. - Fine!

123
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.150
Why do you guys hate each other so much?

124
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.280
Why do all teachers hate all students, Morty?

125
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.592
Because you all break our God damn hearts.

126
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.960
Just seems like there's more going on there.

127
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.262
Was he that bad at math?

128
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.100
No, Morty. Nobody is worse than you.

129
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.400
The hurtful thing about your friend back there

130
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.510
is that at one point, it seemed like he might learn.

131
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.940
I am a nightmare walking,

132
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.460
psychopath talking,

133
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.300
king of my jungle just a gangster stalk stalking.

134
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.100
Stalking. Fuck.

135
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.113
Look at all this non-scholastic depravity!

136
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.320
Reef-er, Cheetos,

137
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.618
and not a smidgen of homework in sight!

138
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.140
Yo, why you coming in here fuckin' up my words?

139
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.880
Uh, T, maybe you ought to go back to school.

140
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.360
You can't keep a beat to save your ass.

141
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.960
Damn. My dream just died.

142
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.100
Here. Follow this. It's called four-four time.

143
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.490
One, two, three, four.

144
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.928
Two, two, three...

145
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.310
I am a nightmare walkin',

146
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.640
psychopath talkin'

147
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.017
king of my jungle just a gangster stalkin'...

148
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.109
Livin' life like a firecracker...

149
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.400
Yo, Chuck! It's Marvin!

150
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.499
Your cousin Marvin D?

151
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.180
Hey. Ya know that new sound you lookin' for?

152
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.528
Well, listen to this!

153
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.420
Ha! Got you again, mutha-fucker!

154
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.036
Wow. You think that guy's cousin would stop taking his calls.

155
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.287
That's not the point, Morty.

156
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.200
You included it in your story.

157
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.820
But I get it. You and T were actually friends.

158
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.085
So what went wrong?

159
00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.127
Nice try, Morty.

160
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.920
You think that if I connect with you,

161
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.330
I'll let you out of detention?

162
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.180
Well, you can forget it! I'm all about boundaries now.

163
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.640
Boundaries! I got it!

164
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.660
Beep boop bop beep beep.

165
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.090
- What is it? - It's a map.

166
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.980
A squared is the length of the galaxy.

167
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.120
B squared is the height.

168
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.840
So C squared takes you directly to...

169
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.240
Planet E-10?

170
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.680
Ain't E-10 supposed to be where God created letters or some shit?

171
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.340
That's just a story we tell lowercase letters at bedtime.

172
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.640
Maybe there's more to it.

173
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.820
- Why bedtime? - What?

174
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.170
He... He said it was a story

175
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.180
you told lowercase letters at bedtime.

176
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.100
Y-You never tell the story during the day?

177
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.860
I guess I just hoped the phrase "bedtime"

178
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.199
would make it easier to understand

179
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.249
that lowercase letters are our version of children.

180
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.860
Oh, so you did that for me?

181
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.079
Well, half the people here are human.

182
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.219
I didn't want to exclude you.

183
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.539
We would have figured out it was children.

184
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.470
Yeah. Lowercase means smaller. We get it.

185
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.009
Feels like I'm being punished for clarity.

186
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.674
Punished? Jesus. I asked a question.

187
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.439
- So did Hitler. - What the fuck is going on?

188
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.136
Somebody set up a call or some shit.

189
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.650
We need to send word to Alphabetrium.

190
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.040
Oxygen-S, we deciphered the "I" of Harmony

191
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.230
and we're headed to E-10.

192
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.760
That's incredible, Water-T.

193
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.068
Give me your coordinates. I'll send help immediately.

194
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.445
Word.

195
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.320
Happy to serve, My Lord.

196
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.630
In quotes.

197
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.070
Secret villain!

198
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.660
Coming out of Helvetica Light Speed

199
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.240
and approaching Planet E-10.

200
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.830
- God damn. - Maybe it knows it's home.

201
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.587
What the math is happening?!

202
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.256
Die, Letter scum!

203
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.091
Aah!

204
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.926
I'm sick and tired of this bullshit.

205
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.137
Yo, 7! Count this!

206
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.389
Three-zus Christ!

207
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.520
Typical letter, acting on emotion.

208
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.039
You're welcome for saving your numbery-ass!

209
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.070
I won't let you take me alive!

210
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.660
Have it your way.

211
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.299
If you're going to act like ignorant children,

212
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.080
I guess the teacher's in charge.

213
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.700
And, young lady, whoever told you numbers can't be emotional

214
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.880
did you wrong.

215
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.400
On Earth, numbers get down.

216
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.090
Sometimes even with letters.

217
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.216
Disgusting!

218
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.060
Uh-huh. See? That's what everyone says.

219
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.720
But then they go home and they type all kinds of shit into Pornhub.

220
00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:16.472
- Scribble! Jot jot! - Uh-oh!

221
00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.350
W-We're surrounded by primitive googas.

222
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.360
Okay.

223
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.563
The primitive googas worship the glowing thing.

224
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.979
Things don't always resolve this fast.

225
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.066
We're making good time.

226
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.740
Scribble! Jot jot! Doodle! Doodle!

227
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.945
We can't understand you.

228
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.719
Obviously, they want to take us to their village

229
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.910
for an Ewok party.

230
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.000
Damn, making really good time.

231
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.020
This tribe claims the artifact comes from a religious site

232
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.085
not far from here.

233
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.628
Awful nice of you to help.

234
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.120
I'm simply following the rules of war as your prisoner.

235
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.780
Or maybe you're hoping if you're nice,

236
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.160
I'll let my guard down so you can take the "I."

237
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.380
How dare you! I'm not a seductress.

238
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.840
I am a warrior.

239
00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.140
And that's not an "I."

240
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.820
- It's a one. - It's an "I."

241
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.260
You guys don't get out much, huh?

242
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.854
It seems kind of obvious

243
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.356
that these Scribbles are like the original species

244
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.759
that letters and numbers came from.

245
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.680
So that relic thing probably isn't a one or an "I."

246
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.200
I-It's probably just, like, a line.

247
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.000
It's symbolic of the fact that your people

248
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.080
don't need to be at war.

249
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.300
- How do I know you again? - Get Schwifty.

250
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.038
It's still nothing. So mind your damn business.

251
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.900
At least we agree on that.

252
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.480
Looks like your detention is officially over.

253
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.080
- Why? - You finally learned

254
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.500
how hard it is to teach.

255
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.700
- No, I didn't. - Then you... learned

256
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.350
- how hard it is to learn. - I already knew.

257
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.340
Just go to bed, you ungrateful shit!

258
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.390
- Cock a doodle! - Cock a doodle two!

259
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.680
The "I," it's gone!

260
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.160
That bitch! 7 took the "I."

261
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.550
- Come on, Mr. Goldenfold. - Count me out, Morty.

262
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.260
I'm tired of helping that son of a bitch.

263
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.660
Seriously? Feels like there's a deeper beef

264
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.940
than missing homework here.

265
00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.080
- What really happened? - It was the summer of 1991...

266
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.660
Any friend of Ice-T is welcome in my home.

267
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.660
And as governor, I can't wait to add

268
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.560
that math wing to Harry Herpson High School, Mr. Goldenfold.

269
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.480
And I shall put it to good use, sir!

270
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.800
Of course you will. More baby potatoes?

271
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.800
God damn, I love rap.

272
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.100
And the Grammy award for Rap Artist of the Year goes to...

273
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.352
Ice-T!

274
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.340
Yo, I just want to thank my words,

275
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.760
the letters that made them,

276
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.360
and that's it!

277
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.988
Nothing else. Peace!

278
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.750
I thought you said he'd thank math.

279
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.580
There must be some mistake. Try a different channel.

280
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.440
The mistake was believing you even knew Ice-T

281
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.320
and could get me that math-loving youth vote.

282
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.415
Now get out of here!

283
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.876
I got a God damn presidential campaign to start.

284
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.920
After that, my dreams faded away like so many erections.

285
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.620
I mean, that sucks, but let's stop Sinistar-7,

286
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.790
and maybe you two sort this out on the way home?

287
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.890
Hmm. Pretty sound logic.

288
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.060
And logic is a part of math!

289
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.350
Whatever. Come on.

290
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.189
If you're pregnant, that's my cell number.

291
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.250
I know you can't read it,

292
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.940
but it's important I made an effort.

293
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.780
- Nice try. - How dare you!

294
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.990
How dare you!

295
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.500
Shit, I think when we started getting it on

296
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.040
that amulet showed us the truth of our origins.

297
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.065
Father!

298
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.568
Hell, yeah. We're into the same sick shit, huh?

299
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.740
No. My father.

300
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.070
- He's here. - W-What's that?

301
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.780
Emperor Dread Nought.

302
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.760
The fate of the Alphabetrians is at hand.

303
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.790
Magma-Q's legacy ends here.

304
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.208
How the fuck did he find us?

305
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.300
Betrayal reveal!

306
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.507
You appear displeased to see me, Prince Water-T.

307
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.140
Cold-ass mutha-fucker, you in league with Dread Nought?

308
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.760
How could you do us Letters dirty like that, S?

309
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.480
My true name is not S.

310
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.933
On Numbericonia they call me...

311
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.760
8!

312
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.080
8?! Oh, my God, he's a number?!

313
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.780
Did you know? I didn't.

314
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.360
Holy shit! I'm not even supposed to be here today.

315
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.140
It's my day off. For real.

316
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.620
That's how much I like working with these people!

317
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.380
Good thing your father isn't alive to see you fail.

318
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.110
He'd be so disappointed.

319
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.180
Mutha-fucker, I'm gonna shoot you in the dick.

320
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.380
Ha! I would like to see you try.

321
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.030
Villain exit.

322
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.780
Thanks for dragging me across the universe

323
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.380
to be killed, Water-T.

324
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.850
No homework-doing, mother-grabbin...

325
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.350
You want to go, old man?

326
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.980
I'll fuck you till you love me.

327
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.640
I'll put your kids through college.

328
00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.431
I'll fucking take you to Boca Raton, you motherfucker!

329
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.620
Ease up, Water-T.

330
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.920
After all, y-you did betray Goldenfold

331
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.563
by, uh, not thanking math at the Grammys, I guess.

332
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.330
That's what you think happened?

333
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.620
Nah, G-Folds, it went like this.

334
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.980
Didja listen to my album, Pop?

335
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.560
It's nominated for a Grammy.

336
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.180
Yes. I heard your album.

337
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.110
What is this four-four time, rhythm nonsense?

338
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.480
It's disgusting!

339
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.180
You're a number-loving traitor

340
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.030
who doesn't care about anything but himself.

341
00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.628
I... I never knew.

342
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.046
You never asked.

343
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.340
Here... Father.

344
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.120
The destiny of the Numbericons is mine to claim!

345
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.230
Everyone has to watch while I do it too.

346
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.460
How does this thing work again?

347
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.724
Allow me, my lord.

348
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.730
Hold up. You're just gonna let this motherfucker...

349
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.566
Aah!

350
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.400
I don't get it.

351
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.320
The ultimate power of the universe is finally mine!

352
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.040
Hey! I am the ruler of the Numbericons.

353
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.543
- The dead rule nothing! - Aah!

354
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.753
Father! No!

355
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.300
Your father was a bitch.

356
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.424
You shall be my general now!

357
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.301
Well, he was a bad father.

358
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.860
I am Infinity,

359
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.900
omnipotent god of numbers!

360
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.820
And I have a world of Letters to destroy!

361
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.380
I guess he doesn't need the ship anymore.

362
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.523
He doesn't need the ship anymore, guys!

363
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.817
You heard Infinity. Move out!

364
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.194
Whoo-hoo! All right!

365
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.362
We could have had something.

366
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.320
It was a mistake, T.

367
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.992
Letters and Numbers can never be.

368
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.959
What do we do? He's going to destroy Alphabetrium!

369
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.060
Whatever. I don't care anymore.

370
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.671
Damn, T. That's cold.

371
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.860
Exactly.

372
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.382
Whoa!

373
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.480
- God damn. - You do remember our adventure!

374
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.560
Not really.

375
00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.540
Wow! Dope shit, T!

376
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.820
If we don't stop Infinity,

377
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.520
he's going to destroy Alphabetrium.

378
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.187
But that ooze-swamp put the kibosh on our spaceships.

379
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.860
M-Maybe we can pull it out and upgrade it

380
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.260
using parts of the Numbers' ship.

381
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.200
Oh, the googas already did it.

382
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.987
- Wow, you guys work fast. - Scribble! Scribble!

383
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.823
Damn, it's like the Glyph Jumper, but extreme.

384
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.371
The Glyph Jumper Extreme is rad!

385
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.420
Let's go home and bust a cap in Infinity's ass.

386
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.760
Wait, let me go pee first.

387
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.160
That way, when we get there, I'll get to say...

388
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.910
Well, I'm not gonna spoil it.

389
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.681
Death to all Letters!

390
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.767
Neither upper nor lower case will survive this day!

391
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.860
The Brackets Shield has fallen!

392
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.660
It's an utter apostrophe!

393
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.680
Aah!

394
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.400
I am bigger than Letters.

395
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.880
I am bigger than Numbers.

396
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.230
My balls are huge,

397
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.600
and everyone can suck my dick!

398
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.119
Stop! You're killing Numbers!

399
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.080
My lord, this is too far!

400
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:23.660
Are you still fucking talking?

401
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.100
Here's a number for you, lady.

402
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.120
86 that ass! You're fired!

403
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.052
Yo, suck this, bitch!

404
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.804
Aah!

405
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.599
Yo, T. Is that your girl?

406
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.200
That's twice I saved your ass.

407
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.191
Infinity's gone mad with power.

408
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.120
He's killing every one...

409
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.520
and every two and every three and every...

410
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.840
- We get it. - I was wrong to join him

411
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.117
and wrong to leave you, Water-T.

412
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.453
Infinity killed both our fathers.

413
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.289
Nuh-uh. I was there. Ceiling fell on him.

414
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.900
Ha!

415
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.334
Father!

416
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.140
That ceiling was poisoned.

417
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.840
Oxygen-S planned Magma-Q's assassination for months.

418
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.675
All my life, I've served such negative numbers.

419
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.761
This kid I don't know was right all along.

420
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.770
- Finally! - It's time for the Numbericons

421
00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.514
to rise and join us.

422
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.851
How can we make the Numbericons rise up against him?

423
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.145
We'll inspire them.

424
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.192
Kill! Murder! Death!

425
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.490
âª Why does a one hate an "I," I gotta wonder? âª

426
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.706
âª When a lower case "I" is an imaginary number âª

427
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.880
âª Who stands to gain when I shoot up a digit? âª

428
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.586
âª The division is complex, but you know we gotta bridge it âª

429
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.089
âª Hey, hey, ohh âª

430
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.000
You think you can stop me with rap, huh?

431
00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.330
âª More homicides than a dodecahedron âª

432
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.240
âª Number V letters the shit that it feeds on âª

433
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.434
âª Today, alpha-numerically combine... âª

434
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.270
âª Like G-L-O-C-K means my ice cold '9 âª

435
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.800
âª I got letters and numbers every time I F a ho âª

436
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.235
âª Giving her one big dick while she screams "O" âª

437
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.280
âª Magma-Q gets 'em wet like she got her cry on âª

438
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.616
âª My dick's 3.14 feet, that's a pie-thon âª

439
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.742
âª Ya'll actin' scared, he ain't won yet âª

440
00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:23.410
âª Infinity to one odds? That's an alpha-bet âª

441
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.500
Father? You like a force ghost now?

442
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.920
The fuck it look like, son?

443
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.770
I came back to help you hand Infinity his ass.

444
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.600
- You ready? - Let's kill it, Pops.

445
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.800
âª Infinity ain't shit without numbers and letters âª

446
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.260
- âª We can blow his ass out âª - âª If we work together âª

447
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.470
âª Rise up, Letters and Numbers, I said rise up âª

448
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.979
âª 'Cause you know we're all brothers âª

449
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.473
âª Oh âª

450
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.320
Arise, King Magma-T!

451
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.233
- Oh, yeah. - Whoa, damn!

452
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.140
My word! Water-T's spittin' straight fire!

453
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.200
He truly is king of Alphabetrium.

454
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.209
Infinity is too strong. Nothing can defeat him.

455
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.160
You think? How about this shit?

456
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.460
The "I" of Harmony!

457
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.780
Muthafuckers just left it.

458
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.100
How will that help us?

459
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.820
This thing loves when Letters and Numbers get down.

460
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.844
Come here, girl.

461
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.220
Mm!

462
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.347
Yeah. You like that, huh?

463
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.720
Hell, yeah!

464
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.090
You cannot stop me!

465
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.770
I'm infinitely infinite!

466
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.442
My fucking dick!

467
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.444
Thought I was lying, mutha-fucker?

468
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.680
Oh, Mr. Goldenfold, I love math!

469
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.035
And it loves you too, Morty.

470
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.550
I have to warn you, I'm a prime number.

471
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.320
I'm only divisible by myself.

472
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.560
Yeah, and my dick's magma now,

473
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.920
but we'll figure it out.

474
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.860
How is that math homework coming along, Morty?

475
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.140
I-It's great. It's... It's so great.

476
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.620
Do you mind if I do a second test, you know, for... for fun?

477
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.724
Ha! You're weird.

478
00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:08.976
And what about you, sir?

479
00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.400
There. All done.

480
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.139
Here's your god damn homework, old man. Happy?

481
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.580
More than you can possibly imagine.

482
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.520
King Magma-T, my people need you.

483
00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.560
And who are you?

484
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.026
Ice Cube of the Geomitrons.

485
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.988
My planet getting all bent out of shape by the Formivores.

486
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.429
You Numbers and Letters strong enough

487
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.949
to fight them muthafuckers?

488
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.690
The warriors of Alpha-Numbericon

489
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.040
are unmatched in strength,

490
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.420
and we never refuse to help our brother in need.

491
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.180
Word. My smokeshow queen speaks truth.

492
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.043
I'll grab my shit and meet you out front.

493
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.640
Cool.

494
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.302
_
