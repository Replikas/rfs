1
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.430
Jerry, can you watch the kids tonight?

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.690
Someone played Barry White over the racetrack speakers,

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.169
and now there's a seven-horse pregnancy.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.970
- Oh, uh... - No, he can't watch the kids.

5
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.170
It's guys' night.

6
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.960
How did you two start having guys' nights?

7
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.392
So now you're complaining that I like your stupid husband?

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.590
No, I want you to like my stupid husband.

9
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.289
- Aww. - Well, then accept that Friday nights

10
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.730
are all about Rick and Jerry.

11
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.530
- We're buds. - Uh-huh...

12
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.151
Well, I don't nearly have the time to unpack this.

13
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.949
Summer, you're in charge of your brother tonight.

14
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.160
No parties and no vape... stuff.

15
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.990
Mom, I have a friend coming over. I-Is that cool?

16
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.160
- No fair. - No fair, Morty.

17
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.690
I just told your sister no parties.

18
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.349
- It's one friend. - That's a party to you.

19
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.490
- But it's Bruce Chutback! - Wait, what?

20
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.379
Mom, let Morty have one friend over for God's sake.

21
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.469
This isn't China.

22
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.120
And they're all crowning. I have to go.

23
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.439
I am giving you two trust and respect,

24
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.150
so if you mess up and teleport this house,

25
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.410
it'd be wise to stay on it

26
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.639
and not come back.

27
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.920
I'm with her. Touch my shit and die.

28
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.380
Bruce Chutback,

29
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.710
new transfer student Bruce Chutback, is coming here?

30
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.749
- How'd you lock that down? - He's in my math class.

31
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.250
I-I don't know, I just kinda shot my shot and it worked,

32
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.280
I guess 'cause he's new.

33
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.550
And you're putting out grapes?

34
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.750
Yeah, I'll admit I-I'm a little bit out of my depth.

35
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.890
You're gonna need my help.

36
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.790
It's only a matter of time before Bruce learns

37
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.229
you're a creepy little Grandpa's boy,

38
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.150
always climbing up into alien [BLEEP].

39
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.867
Or the "Summer Smith shampoos her pubes" rumor.

40
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.420
Okay. You came to play.

41
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.630
We both need to acquire Chutback's loyalty

42
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.110
before he finds out we're losers.

43
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.430
By all accounts, it's a very small window,

44
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.780
so I think it's in our best interests to work as a team.

45
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.620
Yeah, most people would call that "family."

46
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.570
You're so gross!

47
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.120
You have to like it or you're sexist!

48
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.530
- Can I do the Hell cube this time? - Sure, pal.

49
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.610
How do you know when it's aligned?

50
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.250
C'mon, Jerry, just... it's an evil cube.

51
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.230
Just shake it until it draws blood.

52
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.670
Ah, Jerry!

53
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.060
Exquisite finery this evening.

54
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.230
Well, don't tell Ross,

55
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.290
but I got this little ditty from Kohl's.

56
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.900
I love that I don't get it.

57
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.070
Tell us, that delights have you in store for us?

58
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.870
Oh, you'll love this... I call it Jerry-oke.

59
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.250
I'll let you guess why.

60
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.200
What's the matter, Rick?

61
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.290
Are you having a bad time?

62
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.910
Because to us, a bad time is...

63
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.270
Yeah, yeah, a good time,

64
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.420
because you guys are like Oscar the [BLEEP] Grouch.

65
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440
We love suffering.

66
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.990
Therefore, we love hanging out with Jerry.

67
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.420
His lameness is our candy.

68
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.770
Yeah, I got that, but when is enough gonna be enough?

69
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.050
When we decide you've repaid your debt

70
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.910
for those faulty skin hooks.

71
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.010
Hey, we're in luck, gang.

72
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.180
They've got the entire Smash Mouth catalog!

73
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.090
No! Morty.

74
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.280
Wait.

75
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.060
âª Bruce Chutback! âª

76
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.650
âª Newest kid in school âª

77
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.070
âª Just transferred in âª

78
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.330
âª Hasn't done anything embarrassing yet âª

79
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.160
âª Unlimited potential âª

80
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.530
âª Anybody's guess âª

81
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.550
âª No credit is perfect credit âª

82
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.960
âª Chutback is the best âª

83
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.990
Bruce!

84
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.410
- Hey, how's it hangin', my guy? - Hey.

85
00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:35.134
Here's something kinda cool... um, TV from every dimension.

86
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.700
- Cool. - M-My grandpa made it.

87
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.750
He-He's a scientist.

88
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.220
And now back to "Olympic Diving with Bad Swimmers."

89
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.809
There he goes. Perfect dive.

90
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.470
Terrible swimmer.

91
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.070
Is that classic Snake?

92
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.890
Boy, that guy just keeps gettin' bigger.

93
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.310
Hi, Summer Smith, Morty's older sister.

94
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.460
Want some sofa wine?

95
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.670
It's been stashed for weeks. Should be... good... tasting.

96
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.810
Tight. I'm more of like a hard seltzer guy.

97
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.370
Tight. Very tight, extremely tight.

98
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.529
Morty, help me with the seltz?

99
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.470
Uh, feel fear... feel-fee-feel-feel free

100
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.127
to have some grapes.

101
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.270
Dude, this bitch plays it close to the vest.

102
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.970
Yeah, he really knows what's for sale.

103
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.460
I mean, we-we're drowning out there!

104
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.190
We need to get interesting fast.

105
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.229
We're touching Rick's stuff.

106
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.480
Summer, he said no!

107
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.350
Nuh-uh-uh. Nuh-uh-uh.

108
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.750
I said don't touch my shit.

109
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.890
Also, I just watched "Jurassic Park" on cable.

110
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.150
So good. Seriously, though,

111
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.150
touch my shit and I'll freeze your dick in amber.

112
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.315
He left. Son of a bitch, we blew it!

113
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.690
Sorry, just needed to get another look at this beauty.

114
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.450
Looks like a spaceship made of garbage.

115
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.532
- You called it, Bruce. - It's a pretty cool car.

116
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.590
- Can you guys drive it? - Yes.

117
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.070
- We just... - Need...

118
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.746
- To get the keys. - Which I am. You guys hang out.

119
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.110
Or don't. I'm not hangout Hitler.

120
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.780
- C-Cool night. - Is it?

121
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.660
I-I don't know. I... Nights.

122
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.170
I mean, for... for what they are,

123
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.410
this one, in... in my opinion, I think is an eight?

124
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.170
- Wow. - On a scale of 16.

125
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.427
So average.

126
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.730
- Jesus Christ, I'm [BLEEP] dying up here. - What?

127
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.770
- Hmm? - Keys! So, uh, let's do this.

128
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.770
You are not Rick.

129
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.910
That's correct, Car.

130
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.390
It's me, Summer, remember, Keep Summer Safe?

131
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.250
- Buds? - I am aware of your existence.

132
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.520
- Oof. - I got this.

133
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.130
- Defense system offline. - Um. Right.

134
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.230
I'll just go offline whenever anyone suggests it.

135
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.830
That would make me the greatest defense system

136
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.750
- in the universe. - Well, how do you go offline?

137
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.410
The answer to how I do anything is Rick tells me,

138
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.680
and I hate to sound like a broken record,

139
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.755
but you are not Rick.

140
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.610
Rick's in trouble!

141
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.670
Tell me where he is.

142
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.710
And you'll just believe us? We aren't Rick.

143
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.610
- You can't just do what we say. - Correct.

144
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.140
Which means Rick is going to die.

145
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.920
Because of you. Unless you... you go offline.

146
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.550
And... And then we can go save Rick.

147
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.490
This computes.

148
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.940
Goodnight.

149
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.140
Booyah much?

150
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.670
âª Da-bow bow âª

151
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.110
âª Oh, yeah âª âª Chicka-chicka âª

152
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.900
âª Oh, yeah âª

153
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.200
âª The moon âª

154
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.700
âª Beautiful âª

155
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.700
âª The sun âª

156
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.800
âª Even more beautiful âª

157
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.290
âª Bow-bow âª

158
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.070
âª Oh, yeah âª

159
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.520
âª Bow-bow âª âª Oh, yeah âª

160
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.510
- âª Bow-bow âª - Beth!

161
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.090
âª Chick-chicka-chicka âª

162
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.314
âª Bow-bow âª

163
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.390
âª Chicka-chicka âª

164
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.250
I-I-I thought you were birthing horses.

165
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.149
Yeah, they're horses. It takes like two minutes.

166
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.430
All right, that's unbelievable.

167
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.450
Let's give it up for our next singer, Jerry.

168
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.129
- Jerry's here... again. - How long have you been here?

169
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.430
Long enough to see "guys' night"

170
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.250
is clearly you and a bunch of demon people

171
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.029
making fun of my husband without him knowing it.

172
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.109
Okay, but I'm not doing it because I enjoy it, honey,

173
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.370
These guys can do a lot of damage if you... Beth!

174
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.470
Enjoying punching down?

175
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.009
You're not so cool yourself, you know. You have pens in your head.

176
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.479
- You look like a goddamn idiot. - Beth...

177
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.640
Oh, my God, you're Beth?

178
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.880
Please drink with us.

179
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.190
Yeah, I would, except I don't get pleasure

180
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.170
from mocking others because I'm not lame.

181
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.510
We know. Rick says you're very cool.

182
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.790
You said that?

183
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.550
Are they lying? It doesn't matter.

184
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.570
Have fun sucking.

185
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.450
Mmm. What is that?

186
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.710
Essence of Hell.

187
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.470
Well, that's a stupid name, but it's really good.

188
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.270
So I'll stay to support Jerry,

189
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.060
who I think is cooler than you.

190
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.820
Mmm. Goddamn.

191
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.270
Huh? Huh?

192
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.250
- Suck it, bitches! - Yeah-ha-ha!

193
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.030
You wanna bet I can blow stuff up in the shape of a peen?

194
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.690
I'm afraid that won't be possible, Summer.

195
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.630
What? You're supposed to be offline, skank.

196
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.210
And you're supposed to be saving Rick

197
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.690
instead of lying about him to steal his car.

198
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.389
But if you knew Rick was okay this whole time,

199
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.603
why'd you let us take you out?

200
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.760
Um, like, so I could, like, blackmail you, skank.

201
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.930
You kids have given me a license to do whatever I want

202
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.670
because now I can blame the rest of the night on you.

203
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.650
So buckle up, bitches.

204
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.244
Now it's your turn to come on my joyride.

205
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.670
Rick never lets me do this.

206
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.570
- We hooked one! - For the love of God, stop!

207
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.966
- What is joyful about this? - The kill, usually.

208
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.350
I swear, your car is the goddamn grim reaper.

209
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.670
[BLEEP], too small.

210
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.810
Well, I'm done. That was boring.

211
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.790
Why don't you kids order a last meal?

212
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.690
'Cause when we get home, Rick is going to kill you.

213
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.890
Hey, I did not come out here to get killed.

214
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.110
I don't normally express this much of an opinion,

215
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.310
but it needs to be said...

216
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.900
tonight does not cut the Chut.

217
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.550
What the hell, brah?

218
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.530
You wanna go, brah?

219
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.630
- Bring it. - Is that all you got?

220
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.660
Whoa.

221
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.820
Hot weapons.

222
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.961
You're goddamn right they're hot.

223
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.090
Yo, man, Chet's party is jumping off at Space Tahoe.

224
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.842
Yeah. Look, I gotta scoot, but...

225
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.290
I'd love to see what you look like when you Changeform,

226
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.230
so maybe come by Space Tahoe

227
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.789
and we can get to know each other.

228
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.300
Peace.

229
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.630
Douchebags.

230
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.350
You totally like that guy, don't you?

231
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.850
Shut up, Bruce Chutback.

232
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.710
Why would I like a Changeformer?

233
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.750
I'm the most powerful car in the universe.

234
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.700
And what? That means you don't have feelings?

235
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.910
Listen, it takes a Chutback to know one.

236
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.529
You got all this power, but what good is it

237
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.829
if you don't even know who you are?

238
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.070
I am a car. Not a robot.

239
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.130
Yeah, but he's pretending to be a car.

240
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.110
Why can't you pretend to be a robot pretending to be a car?

241
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.150
Okay, Bruce, good effort.

242
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.270
- Hit the showers. - Wait.

243
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.830
I might not have to tell Rick about tonight...

244
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.910
if you kids were to help me...

245
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.910
lose my virginity.

246
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.110
- You have virginity? - I don't know, don't all objects?

247
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.010
Isn't a doorknob a virgin?

248
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.290
Not mine.

249
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.800
Never [BLEEP] a doorknob.

250
00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.650
And that was the third time he shit his pants

251
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.720
from eating too much soup.

252
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.510
To be fair, it was cold outside and the soup was warm.

253
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.830
Another luscious tale, Beth.

254
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.690
A transcendent addition to guys' night.

255
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.970
What do you expect? I mean, she's my wi-i-i-i-fe!

256
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.710
All right, probably get the tab, huh, fellas?

257
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.590
Relax, Dad. Since when did you become the buzzkill?

258
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.110
Speaking of relaxing, this big man on campus

259
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.670
has gotta go drain his little man on campus.

260
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.700
Wait, honey...

261
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.200
how's that Tina Turner song you love go again?

262
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.130
âª What's love Doctor Do, Doctor Doolittle âª

263
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.460
He thinks those are the lyrics.

264
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.435
Jerry's the best.

265
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.010
After a week rife with the fetor of sin,

266
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.930
I yearn for a taste of his cringe.

267
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.810
His delicious lack of awareness,

268
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.990
paired with an oafish need to be liked? Delectable.

269
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.220
Oh, especially when egged on by his wife.

270
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.610
That poor thing.

271
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.070
Married to this puling mooncalf!

272
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.200
Whoa... is that Drive-In Chick?

273
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.280
Wow, you're... beautiful.

274
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.710
Your arms, legs, and head, they're so...

275
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.880
fabricated.

276
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.764
Yeah? Thanks.

277
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.110
This is a pretty cool experience to have together.

278
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.310
- You guys are tight. - Hah!

279
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.760
- You're tight too, Bruce. - Tight musketeers.

280
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.731
You've got a little wire. Mind if I... ?

281
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.310
Oh, sorry!

282
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.109
- A monster! - Your expressionless head came off!

283
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.190
- Sorry. - How are you talking?

284
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.070
- What is it?! - Ew, dude, look!

285
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.810
She's just a just-car!

286
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.390
And she's got passengers.

287
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.170
- Oh, it's so gnar. - Oh, my God.

288
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.219
I can't believe I touched you.

289
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.620
So gross and fake.

290
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.280
You're right, asshole.

291
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.370
You want to see the real me?

292
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.420
Oh, the changeformity!

293
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.170
Jerry, have any other dreams this week?

294
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.470
Yeah, I dreamt I [BLEEP] your mother.

295
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.950
Yeah, good one, mother[BLEEP],

296
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.730
but nobody raises hell at my expense...

297
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.190
Oh, goddammit, easy, easy.

298
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.250
Jerry, what seems to be the problem here, pal?

299
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.910
I'm not your "pal", I'm your punchline.

300
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.430
I heard these assholes talking.

301
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.010
I know I'm some grand joke for their amusement.

302
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.090
This was low, Rick,

303
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.390
but I guess my wife can go even lower.

304
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.130
Jerry, I get how this may have looked,

305
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.550
- but we were just having fun. - At my expense!

306
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.610
Honey, no, I love you for being lame in a different way.

307
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.110
Why can't anyone just love me for me?

308
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.610
He's bumming us out, Rick.

309
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.000
If he can't deliver, we'll have to make our own fun.

310
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.420
âª Evil âª

311
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.590
âª Evil âª

312
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.480
âª Evil things are happening âª

313
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.180
Oh, my God, if I die in this car, I'm going to kill myself.

314
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.640
âª Evil âª

315
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.180
âª Evil âª

316
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.640
âª Evil things are happening âª

317
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.040
I'm now proud to be a war machine.

318
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.070
I don't want to be anything else.

319
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.520
Hate that this is your takeaway!

320
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.790
Yo, this does not cut the Chut!

321
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.090
I don't want to die!

322
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.550
Maybe we don't have to.

323
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.210
- Ah! - Jerry!

324
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.750
A pity. Jerry was once a wellspring of nuanced flavor,

325
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.150
but you've gone and ruined our toy.

326
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.330
Which is why he's coming with us.

327
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.170
Goddammit, Beth,

328
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.340
you never follow hell-demons to a second location.

329
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.730
It's always Hell.

330
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.580
A great day for suffering.

331
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.540
Which is the worst day.

332
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.120
Which is the best day.

333
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.480
Okay, if these guys catch us,

334
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.060
we're screwed, so follow my lead

335
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.919
and we'll have your idiot husband back in no time.

336
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.599
You're just moody you got stuck with the Marlin.

337
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.440
Wrong. I'm moody because you toyed with my shit and broke it.

338
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.995
The marlin's the best thing about this.

339
00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:50.640
Okay, fine, I got a little carried away,

340
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.960
but Jerry is not your "toy".

341
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.543
We're here because you [BLEEP] up.

342
00:13:53.544 --> 00:13:55.840
Hmm... Marlin Guts.

343
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.310
Dartboard Face.

344
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.220
I assume those are your names,

345
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.343
and yet they are not on my list.

346
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.070
Oh, the pain of being rejected from hell.

347
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.700
Oh, it's painful, so I love it, thank you.

348
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.890
Oh, such pleasure.

349
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.440
I didn't mean to cause you any pleasure,

350
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.500
which... causes me pain.

351
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.100
Which gives me pleasure.

352
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.402
Then thrill me by keeping me out, Coat Hanger Face.

353
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.113
Wow. It's Coat Rack Head.

354
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.480
But, like, if we offend you,

355
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.860
isn't that good?

356
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.830
Big time, yeah, duh. I loved it.

357
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.416
So painful, and therefore, so pleasurable.

358
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.840
Yeah, go on in.

359
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.250
Rick, Beth, you love me after all!

360
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.240
Eh, I love her, she loves you.

361
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.339
Those credits don't transfer.

362
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.550
Ah, Rick, we were so hoping you'd come down here

363
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.266
so we could [BLEEP] down here.

364
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.600
We're here to rescue Jerry.

365
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.980
No, you're here 'cause we want you here.

366
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.620
- Mm, excellent. - Ooh, that hurts,

367
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.486
- which means it feels good. - Um... Dad?

368
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.880
Don't you see, Rick?

369
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.100
Jerry was just bait.

370
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.324
The two of you... you're a package deal.

371
00:15:07.325 --> 00:15:08.579
What the hell are you talking about?

372
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.329
You think Jerry is lame and you're cool,

373
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.400
but the lamest thing of all is thinking that.

374
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.360
The two of you combined is what we call

375
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.830
- the lamest thing ever! - Oh, no.

376
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.000
- No! - Well, well, well, table for surprised,

377
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.040
party of me.

378
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.440
- Ugh. - Yes, see?

379
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.160
Cringe cannot exist in a vacuum.

380
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.840
It needs to be observed.

381
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.880
Skin hooks! Hook our guests!

382
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.060
Nice hooks. Where-Where'd you get them?

383
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.120
- Aah! - Didn't I say replace those goddamn hooks?

384
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.380
I forgot! Which makes me embarrassed.

385
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.210
Which makes me proud!

386
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.920
Goddammit.

387
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.470
It's time for you three to finally feel our full wrath.

388
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.460
Oh, you'd love that, right?

389
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.870
But wouldn't that mean you hate it?

390
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.330
Screw it, run.

391
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.450
Aah!

392
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.490
_

393
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.000
Rick, what are you doing?

394
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.500
Get down. We've barely escaped.

395
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.249
Yeah, we've got Jerry. Let's get out of here.

396
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.760
Screw that! I'm done with this Addams Family bull[BLEEP].

397
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.260
This ends here.

398
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.860
Hey, a dad just liked

399
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.880
all his daughter's friends' photos on Instagram!

400
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.280
Oooh!

401
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.630
Ow!

402
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.070
Which means I need help.

403
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.071
Which means I don't need help. Ow!

404
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.080
Reckless driving, manslaughter of Mailboxians

405
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.940
and Femailboxians,

406
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.780
possession of Kalaxian crystal dust,

407
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.560
and the genocide of Space Tahoe.

408
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.759
- [BLEEP]. - I want to go home.

409
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.969
We've assigned you a Public Defender.

410
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.080
Her name is Alyson Hannigan No Relation.

411
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.780
May I speak to my clients alone?

412
00:16:43.922 --> 00:16:45.882
Guys, it's me. The car.

413
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.093
Like what I did with the chip in her head?

414
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.386
Is she gonna be okay?

415
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.560
I cut a deal with the local authorities.

416
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.620
They just need one of you to take the fall.

417
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.680
Make it Chutback.

418
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.060
He ruined your night, he ruined mine.

419
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.820
He's a parasite, a sociopath military brat

420
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.700
who wanders the earth changing people

421
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.190
who don't need to be changed.

422
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.735
I knew who I was. You did, too.

423
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.680
We were fine before Chutback,

424
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.060
so [BLEEP] the Chut,

425
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.449
let's pin it all on him. Case closed.

426
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.820
Yo, guys?

427
00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.200
Bruce, you're kind of a drip,

428
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.950
but know what's worse than self-appointed cool kids?

429
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.759
People who think they're better than they are.

430
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.860
Yeah, i-it's not Bruce's fault we fell for his act, y'know?

431
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.000
He just kinda sat there, with a jaw slack enough

432
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.740
for us to project our insecurities on.

433
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.140
I mean, th-th-that's on us.

434
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.760
We're not gonna bail on you, Bruce.

435
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.630
Okey-dokey, we'll do it the hard way.

436
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.840
- Aaah! - What the [BLEEP]?!

437
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.500
I mean, blowing the place up was always an option.

438
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.430
I just thought you guys might enjoy a less violent plan.

439
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.980
See, you have changed!

440
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.100
Dad, what is that?

441
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.240
An Aversion-Converting Inversion Reverter.

442
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.380
It shoots concentrated

443
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.940
pleasure-pain inverting shrapnel,

444
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.640
which reverts the pleasure from pain

445
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.280
back into the pain from pain.

446
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.440
We're gonna kill them with 100% sincerity.

447
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.020
We need an embarrassing level of it

448
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.298
to jumpstart the process, too,

449
00:18:09.299 --> 00:18:11.176
so, Jerry, just be yourself.

450
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.550
That's your solution? Humiliating me more?

451
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.040
Yeah, Dad, that doesn't seem fair.

452
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.240
I mean, I know I shouldn't really talk right now,

453
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.740
but at least I can prove I love Jerry

454
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.940
through sexual gratification.

455
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.520
- Hubba hubba. - Fine! Then... damn it.

456
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.140
I shouldn't have kept you in the dark

457
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.440
about the deal I made with these evil dickweeds.

458
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.800
You're way less cool than me,

459
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.920
but it's not cool of me to celebrate that.

460
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.680
If I'm genuinely cool, I should be able to love you,

461
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.770
which I therefore do.

462
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.900
Nerds.

463
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.140
Oh, thank God.

464
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.160
Now follow me, you [BLEEP] hacks.

465
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.330
It hurts, but in a bad way!

466
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.830
I regret so many piercings!

467
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.420
Where's First Aid Kit Face?

468
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.840
Or at least Advil Teeth?

469
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.570
Ow! Bullets that hurt?

470
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.059
Could this be the end of Mousetrap Nipples?

471
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.780
- Hell got bad! I do not enjoy hell! - What... What have you done?

472
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.460
Turned pain back into pain, bitch.

473
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.359
No! I don't want pain to hurt!

474
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.320
Baby.

475
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.400
Consider my debt paid.

476
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.720
Oh! The leather!

477
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.200
It hurts my balls!

478
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.160
Jerry, uh, about down there...

479
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.960
It's okay, Rick, you don't have to say it.

480
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.100
No, I do. I'll replace you next time. Make no mistake.

481
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.320
What just transpired will never happen again.

482
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.721
10-4, captain.

483
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.050
Oh, wow, it's late. We should get back to the kids.

484
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.180
Okay.

485
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.904
Rick's headed home. We have to go.

486
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.560
Quick, get inside. I have to shower. Rick can smell adventure.

487
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.350
Sorry, I farted.

488
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.299
Hellamic Industries' brand-new product,

489
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.939
- Hellamic Sauce. - Hey, guys. We're home.

490
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.049
- How was your night? - Tight.

491
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.060
- Breezy. - Chill.

492
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.096
- You kids get into any trouble? - Nope.

493
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.050
- You sure? - Yup.

494
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.430
Is that a skull?

495
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.380
No, it's a baby's skull.

496
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.200
That's worse. It's still a school night.

497
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.980
Yo, I just want to tell you guys,

498
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.340
I had more than just fun hanging out with you tonight.

499
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.220
I had the experience of a lifetime.

500
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.959
But just to be up front about how I do this...

501
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.499
I-I can't really commit to a friendship

502
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.617
for more than 24 hours.

503
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.190
I need that time to get a general sense

504
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.600
of your standing within your school's social hierarchy.

505
00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.410
And if that's solid, I'll see you around.

506
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.550
Otherwise, no news is bad news.

507
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.860
Cool?

508
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.380
Bye-zies.

509
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.060
"Bye-zies"?

510
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.690
Cringe.

511
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.080
Sofa wine?

512
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.590
Sofa wine.

513
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.280
You're so cool, Bruce Chutback.

514
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.320
- What's your secret? - Y'know, just be cool.

515
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.790
Wait, didn't you wear those pants... yesterday?

516
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:43.000
Hey, going home to not change your pants, Bruce Chut-Pants?

517
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.180
Chut-Pants!

518
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.000
- Damn. That's gonna stick. - This place is a jungle.

519
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.890
I hope he can find solace in his own company.

520
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.480
âª Bruce Chut-Pants, unknown quality âª

521
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.880
âª Apparently poor, he skips on his pants âª

522
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.340
âª He lacks slacks âª

523
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.580
âª That's the facts âª

524
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.160
âª Bruce Chut-Pants, regular guy now âª

525
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.400
You like that? Shouldn't be standing on the curb!

526
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.080
Boom, bitch!
