00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.000
Aah!

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.940
Susglamon glabbi blah!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.960

5
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.490
- Pay up. - What?

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.741
Pay up, G-Slice.

7
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.020
I just finished your chores.

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.769
Didn't I just upgrade your ponytail?

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.399
And... And those ghost goggles you asked for

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.510
- are in the vending machine. - Attribute slider.

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.540
- Oh, shit. - Yeah.

12
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.600
Jimmy Haddicker's Frisbee-golf party is tonight,

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.000
I want him sliding all over these attributes.

14
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.550
- Ow! - Sensitive bone marrow much?

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.499
All right, what are we boosting, what are we losing?

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.960
Strength me up, dawg. I want that frolf bod.

17
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.600
- Drop intelligence. - All right, four customizable stats,

19
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.580
- in your... - Come here, nerd.

20
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
No! Ah! Summer! I will literally murder you!

21
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.859
Oh, Christ, you're too dumb to know I'm serious.

22
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.943
Hey, Rick, what are you...

23
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.600
Wait, i-is that an attribute slider?

24
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.600
You're juicing your stats for the frolf party?

25
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.750
- You gonna ruin this for me? - What? No!

26
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.560
I-I-I want one for the party too!

27
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.030
Do some shit for me, bro.

28
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.247
I-I-I helped you kill your nemesis.

29
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.380
Oh, you guys found him?

30
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.700
It's my emotional cheat day.

31
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.800
I am removing myself from this conversation.

32
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.500
I can't believe he gave you that.

33
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.020
I-I've asked for one forever.

34
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.600
'Cause you're a bottom-feeder, Morty.

35
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.900
You beg and eat scraps.

36
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100
I'm an independent woman who eats what she kills.

37
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.305
Come on, Summer! I-I'm your little brother!

38
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.840
Y-You have to take care of me!

39
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.940
Take care of this.

40
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.040
Oh! Agh!

41
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.060
You just hide anywhere, huh?

42
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.270
Kick his ass, Summer!

43
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.348
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.860
- Who are you? - Yeah, but what about this?

45
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.890
Ah, shut up!

46
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.693
- She's juggling! - Whoa!

47
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.320
Bro, is that your sister?

48
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.120
Her dexterity is wild.

49
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.560
Yeah, I guess?

50
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.760
H-Hey, Brad, aren't you a football guy?

51
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.220
Of course, Morty.

52
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.440
But the off season is the frolf season.

53
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.615
Yo, Summer!

54
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.283
Get over here and meet the team captain.

55
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:40.828
_

56
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.190
Oh, hey, guys. So random seeing you here.

57
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.750
Love the way you move that coin.

58
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.919
- Ever consider a bigger disc? - Is your hair different?

59
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.506
Oh. I dunno. I started using this new leave-in conditioner?

60
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.510
I love it.

61
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.760
Maybe leave your number in my phone.

62
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.080
So charismatic.

63
00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.960
Looks like we found our new center-forwardback.

64
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.760
Gross! She's just using tech to customize herself

65
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.740
- for social situations! - Bro, maybe you should too.

66
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.870
You're harshing the buzz.

67
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.106
- Can you give us a sec? - Ow! Hey!

68
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.200
You're embarrassing yourself.

69
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.193
Leave or I will make you leave.

70
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.119
Just let me borrow it for a second, then I'll go.

71
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.739
What do you even want it for, you parasite?

72
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.709
I-I wanna be ripped and... and take my shirt off in front of Tricia!

73
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.020
Ew! You worm! She's my best friend!

74
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.454
She's not even in your grade!

75
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.680
It's a trickle down effect!

76
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.248
She'll see me and tell everyone!

77
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.833
Okay, time to go.

78
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.620
- Yeah, Summer! Dump the chump! - She's juicing!

79
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.500
The device makes her cool!

80
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.965
Go Summer! Go Summer!

81
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.091
Juice it up!

82
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.750
- Aah! - Not so strong now, huh?

83
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.056
Good luck with... ha, intelligence. My turn.

84
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.266
Ow!

85
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:46.434
_

86
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.562
- Whoa. - That's more like it.

87
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.148
Morty. Wait 'til the girls hear this.

88
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.025
Let's see if these abs are waterproof.

89
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.560
Ah! Ah!

90
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.249
- Wow, smart throw. - Yeah, really thought out.

91
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.560
Now this is some shit.

92
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.500
This is what frolf is about, bro!

93
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.340
You pubescent little simian, I will end you.

94
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.640
- No. - Ugh!

95
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.720
Okay. No.

96
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.192
Not what frolf is about.

97
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.590
Open your miiind!

98
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.447
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

99
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.074
Um, no thank you.

100
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.280
Dude, no way. Summer's got a Kuato!

101
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.320
A what-o?

102
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.787
Um, a Kuato?

103
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.164
Oh, my God. She doesn't even know what a Kuato is!

104
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.400
I-I know what that is. I'm... I'm cool!

105
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.043
Jimmy, your leave-in conditioner!

106
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.140
Ugh! Agh!

107
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.046
Look at how desperate she is!

108
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.960
- Boo! - Yeah, come on, guys! Boo her!

109
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.219
Boo!

110
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.640
And now back to... "Cake or Fake?"

111
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.980
Please! Come on, you have to know!

112
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.103
Do I not breathe?

113
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.380
- Do I not speak? - Hmm.

114
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.800
- Give me the knife. - Agh, no! Oh, my God! Please!

115
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.235
- I'm not a cake! I'm not a cake! - Grandpa! I'm a literal monster!

116
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.320
And you're blocking the TV. What's up?

117
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.490
Oooopen your miiiind!

118
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.660
Ho-lee shit! A Kuato?

119
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.420
Whoa. How... How the fuc...

120
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.509
Morty messed with my slider

121
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.480
and we fell in a pool and everyone booed!

122
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.299
Thought the slider was gonna be the whole thing this week.

123
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.500
- Wow. - It's not wow, you Grinch!

124
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.040
Why do you care about high schoolers? This is a Kuato.

125
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.190
From "Total Recall"?

126
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.249
T-They're basically the crown jewel of psychic mutants.

127
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.420
Yeah, everyone knows but me!

128
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.660
They fucking shamed me for it!

129
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.847
Huh. Water must've fried the gene sequencer.

130
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.520
Your spines are braided?

131
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.600
Christ, what a mess.

132
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.820
- You need to fix this, Grandpa! - Okay, pay up.

133
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.330
- What? - Pay up, S-Slice.

134
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.569
Thought you killed what you ate.

135
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.180
Chore wheel's empty. If you work fast,

136
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.319
I'll fix it in the morning.

137
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.520
Open your miiind!

138
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.540
See, Morty gets it.

139
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.500
Gah! You're worse than he is!

140
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.530
Ooopen your miind!

141
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.880
God, shut up.

142
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.880
Ugh.

143
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.600
Ooopen your miind!

144
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.080
_

145
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.210
_

146
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.030
_

147
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040
What the hell?

148
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.260
Ooopen your miiind!

149
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.570
Ugh, God damn it, Morty,

150
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.930
you're even messing up my targeted ads.

151
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.000
I partied with other Kuatos and had the time of my life.

152
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.300
Kuatos rule! Whoo!

153
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.380
Ugh, whatever.

154
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.150
_

155
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.880
Ugh!

156
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.198
You know what? Fuck this noise.

157
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.121
_

158
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.780
Nice Kuato.

159
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.020
Open your miiind!

160
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.360
Preaching to the choir.

161
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.520
Have fun.

162
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.070
Oh, my glob, your hair-Kuato combo is out of this world.

163
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.710
Oh, uh, wow, I, uh... I love your tumor-face guy.

164
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.480
You're hilarious.

165
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.770
- What'll it be? - Open your miiind!

166
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.800
Coming right up.

167
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.200
Hey, sorry. I couldn't help but notice your Kuato.

168
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.240
He's huge!

169
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.370
Oh, um... Thank you?

170
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.040
I'm Kwyatt, and this is Godiva.

171
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.720
Summer, and uh, this little guy is Morty.

172
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.338
Open your mind!

173
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.540
Open your mind!

174
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.410
Wow, I guess they all say that, huh?

175
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.600
You guys celebrating something?

176
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.300
Yeah, being Kuatos.

177
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.980
We're kinda like VIPs here.

178
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.740
Who's your new friend, Kwyatt?

179
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.960
- She's cute. - This is Summer and Morty.

180
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.300
You guys should join us at our table!

181
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.730
Whoo!

182
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.180
I mean, if you can handle some rowdy Kuats,

183
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.320
you should come hang.

184
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.400
Open your miiind!

185
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.575
Sounds like we're down to clown.

186
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.042
Wow. You guys do this all the time?

187
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.220
It's a tight knit community!

188
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.920
Feels like we're part of the future, you know?

189
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.010
Yeah, being a mutant is rad.

190
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.320
Open your miiind!

191
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.390
- What? - Open! Your! Miiind!

192
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.820
Totally.

193
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.390
I love being a Kuato!

194
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.760
Whoo!

195
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.600
- Who's that guy? - Kenneth.

196
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.920
He kinda pays for all this. You wanna meet him?

197
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.982
- Obviously. - Ken!

198
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.734
This is Summer and Morty.

199
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.020
They're new to the scene, but they are the real deal!

200
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.880
New friends! Champagne?

201
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.000
So open-minded of you.

202
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.300
We're a rare breed!

203
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.420
Open your mind!

204
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.940
- What? - Open! Your! Mind!

205
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.300
Oh, my God, your Kuato is so funny.

206
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.585
To Kuatos!

207
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.003
To the future!

208
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.900
You wanna get outta here?

209
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.778
Hell yeah I do.

210
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.865
This is, like, the best night I've had in a while.

211
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.408
Welcome to life as a Kuato.

212
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.993
Open your mind!

213
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.529
Like, this whole time I thought my brother

214
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.920
was an anchor holding me back,

215
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.070
but he's, like, a key, to something I never even imagined.

216
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.460
Sounds like he... opened your mind.

217
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.200
So did you.

218
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.660
- What's wrong? - I'm... Ugh. I'm sorry.

219
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.930
Wait, "I'm sorry", like, you have a girlfriend?

220
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.660
Or "I'm sorry", like, something much worse?

221
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.780
Oh! Fuck! Let go! Let me go!

222
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.645
- Hold her steady! - Open your mind!

223
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.980
- Hold him steady too! - Open your mind!

224
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.480
Open... your... mind.

225
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.322
Wha...

226
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.330
Where...

227
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.360
Morty?

228
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.953
Shit, shit, shit.

229
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.290
What was the activation phrase?

230
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.953
"Ponytail assemble"?

231
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.000
"Go go lock-picking ponytail"?

232
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.350
I don't give my grandpa enough credit?

233
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.080
The oven's mostly for bodies,

234
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.810
but I make pizzas in here too.

235
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.840
Ugh!

236
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.940
Ah! Ah! Ah! No!

237
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.520
Arrivadeadci, bitch.

238
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.980
Sorry, no time to save you more than I just did.

239
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.540
Gotta find my brother!

240
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.459
- Jesus, shit! - Agh, what the hell, Beth?

241
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.480
You're paying for those!

242
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.600
- Just yell my name like normal! - I did!

243
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.940
Why do you think I risked it with the tongs?

244
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.640
Huh. I-I guess I did drink a lot last night.

245
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.200
Marathon of "Cake Or Fake". The... The sentient cakes,

246
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.060
they... they keep you guessing, you know?

247
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.440
- Where are my kids? - Merged?

248
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.420
That doesn't answer my question and raises several others.

249
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.620
Relax, sweetie. Summer's just doing chores.

250
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.900
Which I will check on.

251
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.680
By myself. Without your tongs.

252
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.350
Summer?

253
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.380
Summer?

254
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.500
Summer?

255
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.760
Agh! God damn it!

256
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.700
Summer! You let them get hungry!

257
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.260
_

258
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.480
Wait, w-why is this in black and white?

259
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.940
For dramatic effect.

260
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.860
I didn't design you for dramatic effect.

261
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.870
You made me sound like your dead wife.

262
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.210
Just color the fuckin' picture.

263
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.040
We're kinda like VIPs here.

264
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.160
I mean, if you can handle some rowdy Kuats, you could join us?

265
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.261
I bet you say that to all the mutant girls.

266
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.470
- He does. - Holy shit! I'm just a pretty face!

267
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.780
- I'm just a handsome guy! - Where's Morty?

268
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.269
He's... He's in a good place! He's happy! It's nice!

269
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.100
He's in a "Taken" house!

270
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.980
We're gonna put him on the highest bidder!

271
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.020
- Take me to him! - They'll kill me!

272
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.960
Okay, all right. I'm sorry. I'll do it.

273
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.449
So, he wasn't into me?

274
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.900
O-Open your...

275
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.640
- O-Open your... - There he is. Man of the hour.

276
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.700
- How is our big boy? - Finally stable.

277
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.840
Should be ready for transplant in a few hours.

278
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.840
- Good. - Open your... mind.

279
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.426
Why do I do it?

280
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.420
Kuatos have always had a revolutionary spirit,

281
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.500
and there's nothing more revolutionary

282
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.560
than me being rich.

283
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.460
You think anyone in that VIP section was born a Kuato?

284
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.980
You're a rare breed, Morty,

285
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.140
and we're gonna put you on someone who values that.

286
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.694
Aah!

287
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.880
Where is she?!

288
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.780
Sh... She paid me, man! She used the taxi app!

289
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.409
I make less than minimum wage and I got five kids!

290
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.009
Sorry, man. I-I guess I got really excited

291
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.060
to beat someone up for information.

292
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.623
Aah! Where'd you take her?!

293
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.460
- Come on! Ow! - Where is she?!

294
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.609
She just ordered a drink!

295
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.020
Aah! I-I spent a long time mixing it!

296
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.841
- She didn't even tip! - Shit, sorry. Wrong guy again.

297
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.639
- Thought I'd be better at this. - Whatever you say, man.

298
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.970
- Just don't hit me again! - Who'd she leave with?!

299
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.320
Aah!

300
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.600
- Where is she?! - I'll never tell you!

301
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.019
Oh, okay, y-you actually know?

302
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.979
Wait, wait, isn't that why you're punching me?

303
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.000
It is now!

304
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.565
What did you do to her?!

305
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.610
Where is she?!

306
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.400
Shit, man! Right there!

307
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.560
- Grandpa? - Oh, Summer.

308
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.230
Okay, awesome.

309
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.220
Who's this? Hot Guy Who Trafficked You?

310
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.250
I'm Kwyatt.

311
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.970
I'm kind of on a roll. Can I...

312
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.550
Oh, God! No, no, no!

313
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.810
How'd you get here first?

314
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.160
I guess even when I'm bad, I'm still pretty good.

315
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.660
So, what's Morty saying to you?

316
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.610
- Where is he? - What? How would I know?

317
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.150
Y-You didn't form a psychic link?

318
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.000
No, we didn't form a psychic link.

319
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.119
- What the fuck is that? - That's like the whole thing!

320
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.600
Crown jewel of psychic mutants, Summer.

321
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.100
You used him to get with cool kids,

322
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.224
but didn't even activate your powers?

323
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.830
It's kind of a Kuato's whole deal.

324
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.190
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

325
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.040
All right, so how do I hear him?

326
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.180
Open your mind, Summer?

327
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.310
Christ.

328
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.420
Hello?

329
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.840
Morty?

330
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.449
- Morty! - Summer?

331
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.535
Summer! Is that you?

332
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.828
Morty, I can hear you!

333
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.180
Thank fucking Christ, you bitch!

334
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.530
I've been screaming for hours!

335
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.374
All right, well, I don't have to hear you.

336
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.835
Sorry! A-And I'm sorry about the frolf party.

337
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.502
I-I think they're selling me, Summer! Hurry!

338
00:14:39.503 --> 00:14:40.920
They're selling him, Grandpa!

339
00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.757
- Well, obviously. - Well, obviously.

340
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.280
You don't have to do this!

341
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.428
What we had was real!

342
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.348
Prepare to get opened.

343
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.391
Don't shoot!

344
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.540
I didn't tell them anything!

345
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.100
Except where and how to find you.

346
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.960
He's outlived his usefulness.

347
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.980
Kill him.

348
00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.233
Aaaah!

349
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.000
Oh, shit, psychic warfare!

350
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.000
- What? - Hold on, Grandpa's got this.

351
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.180
Oh, shit! Run!

352
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.070
Whoa, psychic Grandpa.

353
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.680
No, look. Fake temple with a high pitch noise maker.

354
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.240
Run before these guys figure it out!

355
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.620
He's a fake, you morons!

356
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.708
Like most psychics! Kill them!

357
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.420
- Summer! - I'm coming, Morty!

358
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.837
- Where are you? - I dunno!

359
00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:22.620
Th... They're moving me! I'm on the move!

360
00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.340
This next one comes with a hat.

361
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.676
Oh, shit!

362
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.440
That's what frolf is about, bitch!

363
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.520
Ohhh, Frisbee plus golf.

364
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.560
- I get it now. - Summer, hurry!

365
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.020
Open your mind!

366
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.660
Where do you think they got that one?

367
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.940
Whose chest is that big?

368
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.019
We don't have time for this.

369
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.779
Hey, why do you get to kick down all the doors?

370
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.720
I wanna kick one. Ow, shit!

371
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.410
It's locked! My ankle!

372
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.280
What is this, your first "Taken"?

373
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.000
Ah! Fuck you, Summer!

374
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.501
I rescue Morty seven times per season!

375
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.520
- Summer! The boat, Summer! - Morty! I see it! I see the boat!

376
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.400
Here, Summer, check this out.

377
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.720
- "Check this out"? - Yeah, window jump.

378
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.520
Try to say it's my first "Taken" now.

379
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.266
- It's your first "Taken". - I'm getting my groove back!

380
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.760
You heard him, boys! Kill him before he gets his groove!

381
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.900
Ow!

382
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.192
Ow! Fuck!

383
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.369
None of this would have happened

384
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.520
if you just unmerged us when I asked!

385
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.280
Morty gets everything for free!

386
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.532
Morty's a dog!

387
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.493
People have cats because their affection is earned.

388
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.371
I treat you like an equal because I respect you

389
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.770
You remind me of your grandmother.

390
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.100
- What? - What?

391
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.040
No, I said, "What?"

392
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.099
Oh, you're getting choked.

393
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.670
Go go ponytail secret move!

394
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.760
Oh, my God! What?

395
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.080
Hair, stop!

396
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.160
- I need you to remove that. - Ungrateful.

397
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.010
How's Morty?

398
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.060
Morty! You okay?

399
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.720
Sorry, I just killed a guy with my hair.

400
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.220
No, I'm not okay! I-I'm still on the boat!

401
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.351
Hurry!

402
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.120
- Open... Open your mind! - Sedate him.

403
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.120
We're meeting his buyer in an hour.

404
00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.980
- Ow! - Open your miiind!

405
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.447
Easy there. It'll all be over soon.

406
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.870
Aw, shit! Bite me twice, shame on me!

407
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.140
Whoa!

408
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.787
Oh, man.

409
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.970
Inject me once...

410
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.340
Sir! They're inbound, what should we do?

411
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.780
Kill them, idiot!

412
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.840
There are days, and there are days.

413
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.020
Kenneth, you're the crown jewel of psychic assholes.

414
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.380
Quite an entrance.

415
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.560
Now, for mine.

416
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.020
That's the reveal? You slide off?

417
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.970
You think I'm done revealing?

418
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.670
That's right, it's me!

419
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.580
A smaller Kuato.

420
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.908
The mastermind behind it all.

421
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.329
I sold out my own kind, and I'd do it again!

422
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.699
Wow, who could've seen that coming?

423
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.980
I mean, he can talk.

424
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.200
That's kinda surprising.

425
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.220
Yes. Everyone always assumed that charming Kenneth was the brains.

426
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.088
Or perhaps his Kuato.

427
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.040
But I was in control!

428
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.342
Aah!

429
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.552
- Morty! - Damn, Morty, big air!

430
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.790
Stop it!

431
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.604
Open your mind.

432
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.897
You wanna die?

433
00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.980
Ah!

434
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.250
You little shit!

435
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.980
Whoa, he's got a knife!

436
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.320
Not just any knife.

437
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.220
- Kuato knife! - Oh! Oh!

438
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.380
Hey, stop! That's mine!

439
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.990
Shit, fuck!

440
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.330
Oh, shit! It has missiles!

441
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.820
You think this is a joke?

442
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.302
You're about to die.

443
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.600
So I'll let you in on my true secret...

444
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.240
Those last three guys were chumps.

445
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.560
I'm the real top dawg.

446
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.730
Oh, shit, is that three or four? I've lost count.

447
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.480
But wait, if you're dazzled now...

448
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.652
Okay. I see where this is going.

449
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.656
Hey... No! No! Ah!

450
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.680
No! Ow!

451
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.490
What? No! No!

452
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.120
Noooo!

453
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.160
Man, kind of a shame.

454
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.980
That spider thing was pretty cool.

455
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.110
Yeah. I wanted it.

456
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.339
- Morty says he wanted it. - Oh, o-okay.

457
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.799
Here.

458
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.780
Oh, wh... whoops.

459
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.550
You gotta jiggle it more.

460
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.220
Obviously I'm jiggling it, Summer!

461
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:44.240
Well, not hard enough.

462
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.700
Morty says, "Not hard enough."

463
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.729
I-I must have it set up for motion smoothing.

464
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.890
I-I gotta upgrade the polling rate.

465
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.330
Jesus, what are you, a lifeguard?

466
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.363
Just jiggle it!

467
00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.210
I'm alive! I'm alive!

468
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.400
No! Wait!

469
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.700
I have so much more to reveal!

470
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.640
Ah! Nooo...

471
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.450
There we go.

472
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.540
Oh, yeah, this is great.

473
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.980
Whoa, Morty, looking good.

474
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.240
Bro, you're actually like a fucking boss.

475
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.660
Wait, can that thing jump?

476
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.420
Oh, my God. Bro.

477
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.306
Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf!

478
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.976
Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf!

479
00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.270
Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf! Frolf!

480
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.359
And the Harry Herpsons win!

481
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.196
Yeah, Morty! That's a par!

482
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.440
- Morty! Yeah! - Open your mind!

483
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.580
Hey, did you see that par?

484
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.082
Morty's killer out there.

485
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.540
Yeah. He's not even using his missiles.

486
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.260
Speaking of... I kinda need a new girl to hook up with on Tuesdays?

487
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.680
Eh. Pass.

488
00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.259
- Hey, you wanna get out of here? - Totes.

489
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.840
Summer saved me from being trafficked and burned alive.

490
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.080
It's, like, whatever.

491
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.980
Damn, Summer Smith.

492
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.460
There is no end to your complexity.

493
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.830
Ah, there's the missiles.

494
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.780
O... Open your mind!

495
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.559
Open your mind!

496
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.590
Yes, well, my new Kuato was named Morty,

497
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.355
but I'm going to call him Sixty-Nine.

498
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.800
Kenneth's running a little late with the package, no?

499
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.220
Oh, he'll show.

500
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.860
Do you know how much I paid?

501
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.532
69 million flurbos.

502
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.120
I had 70 of course, but...

503
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.520
69.

504
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.100
I have 69 credit cards.

505
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.400
My wife wanted to have sex,

506
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.280
but I said no, not unless we 69.

507
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.830
- TMI, Michael. - You have a wife?
