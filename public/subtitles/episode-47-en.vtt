WEBVTT

1
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.440
Are we... are we gonna put it back when we're done with it?

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.940
Why? The only thing of value on it is the secret treasure map.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.879
The rest is just instructions for running a country,

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.119
and I'm pretty sure they're online.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.500
It just feels a little wrong...

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.259
Morty, are you gonna be a [BLEEP] America nerd

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.340
or are you gonna be cool and steal the Constitution with Grandpa?

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.880
Here, hold this while I crack the hermetic seal.

9
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.520
W-Why not just use this again?

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.600
Morty! You just destroyed the map

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.089
and activated the giant assassin hidden in the Statue of Liberty!

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.430
I'm sorry... w-wait, what?

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.600
It was a Trojan horse, Morty. Never trust the French.

14
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.630
All right, fun's fun,

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.599
but now the federal government's gonna be pissed again.

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700
Way to go. And on America's birthday

17
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.390
or whatever the [BLEEP] Thanksgiving is.

18
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.049
Rick and Morty! You are under arrest

19
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.080
and surrounded by an anti-portal shimmer!

20
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.500
Come out with your hands up!

21
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.560
Well, Happy Thanksgiving to me.

22
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.220
Can't wait to see what a "shimmer" does to my prostate.

23
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.306
Dad, can you please just end whatever this is...

24
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.170
I understand you're upset, Mr. President.

25
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.439
It's honestly all Morty's fault.

26
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.660
But in the meantime, you really want to keep your army

27
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.813
of pointlessly camouflaged Eagle Scouts off my lawn.

28
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.820
Don't tell me what I want, you anti-American

29
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.029
piece of [BLEEP], you terrorist!

30
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.490
You know, you use that word so much

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.960
it's lost all meaning, Mr. P.

32
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.860
It's like, at this point, what's a terrorist?

33
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.365
It's a guy you don't like. Big deal.

34
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.380
Hoo-rah!

35
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.260
Told you to stand down.

36
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.600
You just lost two soldiers over here. Good men.

37
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.519
Might be time to look at the terrorist in the mirror.

38
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.540
You want a war?!

39
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.100
I'll put your outer-space ass in a goddamn Phantom Zone

40
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.719
with a bar of kryptonite soap around your neck.

41
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.640
You're done, Sanchez! You hear me?

42
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.140
Oof. He's really pissed this time.

43
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.779
Why don't you guys just [BLEEP] and get it over with.

44
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.220
Okay, well, thank you, Summer,

45
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.629
but I think I've got a better option.

46
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.940
- Dad, no. - Ehh... hands are tied, sweetie.

47
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.139
I have to turn myself into a turkey and trick the President

48
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.900
into giving me a Presidential turkey pardon.

49
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.000
Again? How many times have you done this?

50
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.959
I don't know, Jerry, how many years have I lived here?

51
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.559
- Careful how you answer that. - Geez, Rick,

52
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.880
y'know, y-you've done this a lot.

53
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.019
Don't you think the President might see it coming this time?

54
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.800
He probably will, Morty. That's all part of the dance.

55
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.240
In the past, I've inserted myself

56
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.330
into the potential turkey pardonee population

57
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.350
by brainwashing the presidential turkey wrangler

58
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.372
prior to the ceremony.

59
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.660
But this time, the turkey wrangler's been euthanized

60
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.080
and the turkeys will be transported

61
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.680
by armored military vehicles.

62
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.030
Vehicles manufactured by ghost corporations that I control.

63
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.490
- Which we have audited. - Allowing me access to...

64
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.979
- Central computers... - To track the...

65
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.240
Real armored transports, which he can never...

66
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.580
Totally track and sneak aboard.

67
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.320
And even if he does, he'll be on a truck

68
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.600
full of turkeys and fully armed marines.

69
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.640
Who won't recognize me because the human eye

70
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.104
is inherently face blind to turkeys.

71
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.070
Fortunately, those marines won't have human eyes.

72
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.240
- They'll have turkey eyes. - Jesus ever-loving Christ,

73
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.620
why don't you two just [BLEEP] and get it over with?

74
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.540
Careful, Dwayne. You're only Vice President

75
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.260
because I need 10% of the white vote.

76
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.960
There's a giant French assassin attacking New York,

77
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.320
and you're using the war room to measure dicks

78
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.400
with your alcoholic sci-fi boyfriend?

79
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.940
Rick Sanchez is more dangerous

80
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.030
than some steam-powered French bitch,

81
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.160
and New York can handle its own global emergencies.

82
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.465
General? Initiate Operation Deep Gobble.

83
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.470
Coop, not on Thanksgiving.

84
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.920
It's what I trained for, Mary Lou.

85
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.750
- It ain't our fight. - Baby.

86
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.360
That little race car driver you got bakin' in your belly.

87
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.260
What world you want him rearin' up in?

88
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.690
One where some... spiky-haired Doctor Who

89
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.900
in a lab coat can change the color of the sky?

90
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.490
Or a world where he can fill his pickup with hot dogs

91
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.840
and drive it to a jukebox

92
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.090
full of our demographic's current favorite music?

93
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.656
Obviously the latter, but...

94
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.240
Well, that world, Mary Lou, the one with those meals,

95
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.320
vehicles, and songs people in this 30-mile area prefer...

96
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.060
that world needs a few good men.

97
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.800
In a secret Pentagon lab.

98
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.083
Turning into turkeys.

99
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.160
You come back without feathers, Coop.

100
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.839
God, I love this country.

101
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.468
Hoooo-ah!

102
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.860
âª I got a pregnant girl and a pickup truck âª

103
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.320
âª I got one by choice and the other by luck âª

104
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.420
âª But now it's time to turn into a turkey âª

105
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.330
âª I hope there can be peace one day âª

106
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.630
âª Till then, I pray my DNA âª

107
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.090
- _ - âª Gets backed up âª

108
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.510
These pills contain tracking chips

109
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.760
that identify each of you as individuals.

110
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.340
That will be important later.

111
00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:42.201
âª Gobble, gobble âª

112
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.980
âª Gobble, gobble âª

113
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.760
âª When I turn into a turkey âª

114
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.610
All right, boys, search every bird.

115
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.200
If Sanchez is here, I wanna hear you gobblin'.

116
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.780
Let me look at you, scum.

117
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.200
Get outta here, you wobbleneck.

118
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.820
Sarge, this... this ain't like the simulation, man.

119
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.790
- I don't like it. - Keep it together, Martinez.

120
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.330
Eyes are on the ground, sir.

121
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.521
- No sign of Einstein. - Stay frosty, gentlemen.

122
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.566
I want this pardoning pipeline airtight.

123
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.560
Sir! We have hacked the garage door.

124
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.510
We are in. Eyes on the bogey.

125
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.030
Or you've got eyes on a robot.

126
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.680
All due respect, sir, I know flesh when I see it!

127
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.243
Those flesh-covered robots should buy us some time.

128
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.560
The pardonable turkeys should be on that truck.

129
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.800
Ship, go stealth.

130
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.370
Rodriguez, Fincher. Get eyes on that.

131
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.460
Huh. Turkey Marines.

132
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.020
The President came to play. Jam those two radios.

133
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.250
Confirmed.

134
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.740
Ah! Geez!

135
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.340
Fincher, Rodriguez, come in!

136
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.060
Copy, copy, tango, all good.

137
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.640
Just a couple of branches on the roof.

138
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.670
Don't ever turn your radio off again.

139
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.119
- We will not surrender. - We will never surrender.

140
00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.790
- We will not surrender. - Oh, yeah?

141
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.405
Bring in the David Blaine box.

142
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.640
Damn, is that a David Blaine box?

143
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.879
I told you we should have just gone to my parents' house.

144
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.020
- No, you didn't. - Well, I didn't say it out loud,

145
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.520
but it should be well known by now

146
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.124
that I'd always rather be there.

147
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:14.419
- Oh, God, oh, no! - Aw, geez, Rick!

148
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.500
Sir, we've got Rick and Morty inside the box!

149
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.200
- Then that confirms it. - Sir?

150
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.799
No David Blaine box can hold Rick Sanchez.

151
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.070
Scan the turkey truck!

152
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.200
Huh. That's weird.

153
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.510
ID chips for Fincher and Rodriguez are glitching.

154
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.600
Sanchez...

155
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.540
I'll deal with this bastard myself.

156
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.690
Sir, don't be a cowboy.

157
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.720
- You can't get re-elected dead. - System is calibrated, sir.

158
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.659
That pill contains a tracking chip that will identify...

159
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.630
I know, it'll be important later!

160
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.240
Do it.

161
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.660
Moments from now,

162
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.560
the President will be pardoning a turkey...

163
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.700
Home stretch, Morty.

164
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.980
Here comes dip [BLEEP] right on schedule.

165
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.380
Nothing can go wrong now.

166
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.009
- Jesus, is that... - Oh, [BLEEP].

167
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.209
The President has the upper hand.

168
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.599
G-Grandpa [BLEEP] up. Sunglasses on.

169
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.739
- Act like a turkey. - What? Wha...

170
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.320
- Are you scared? - Act like a turkey!

171
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.960
- That's Rodriguez and Fincher, sir. - It's Rick and Morty,

172
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.740
you useless [BLEEP] stump humper!

173
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.420
Sorry, don't tell 10% of your friends I called you that.

174
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.470
Mr. President.

175
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.280
Sanchez, admit it. You lose.

176
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.186
Say it and I'll let your loser ass go.

177
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.639
Did you just try to spit in my face with no saliva gland?

178
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.760
Just pardon me, dick.

179
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.859
- Why the hell would I? - Oh, I dunno,

180
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.240
'cause if I move to Canada,

181
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.279
they'll be the best country!

182
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.029
I'll peck your goddamn eyes out!

183
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.198
Ow! Hey!

184
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.500
- Shit! My plume! - Hey, back off!

185
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.840
Blueberries! We got blueberries down!

186
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.999
Hold your positions, it's a feeding frenzy!

187
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.300
I-I can't see. I mean, I can see.

188
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.610
270 degrees... it's too many degrees!

189
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.140
Sir, we are losing the mental game down here.

190
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.339
Keep it together, soldier!

191
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.410
POTUS is still in that pen...

192
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.960
We just lost New York to France!

193
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.521
Pull out the President right now!

194
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.740
Gobble Tango... I want POTUS out of that pen!

195
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.980
That is an order! Locate the president's chip!

196
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.500
Roger, roger.

197
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.730
There he is, I got him.

198
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.720
Let's go, boys! Let's fly out the Eagle!

199
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.242
Hey, that's not me!

200
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.180
Package is secure. Pull us out.

201
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.650
Reinjecting subject DNA.

202
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.460
Hoppin' Jehovah, you look like five pounds of shit

203
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.940
in a whore's lunchbox.

204
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.580
You all right, Mr. President?

205
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.932
Yes. I am... the President.

206
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.210
Clean his ass up and get him to the War Room.

207
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.540
Hey! Gobble Squad! You got the wrong guy, you morons!

208
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.580
Look at this dumb piece of [BLEEP].

209
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.567
Gobbling away. Get back in there!

210
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.403
All right, boys, you heard the VP.

211
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.470
Pardon is tits up.

212
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.050
Pack up and ship out!

213
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.780
As for you, Sanchez...

214
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.020
bon appÃ©tit.

215
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.840
Where is this elevator going?

216
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.190
Where all the unchosen turkeys go.

217
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.740
The feeding chamber.

218
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.020
- What the [BLEEP] is that? - Not what... who.

219
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.370
The only thing to fear is... me!

220
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.539
How the [BLEEP] does the White House

221
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.400
have a cloned spider of FDR?

222
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.830
It's no clone, it's FDR.

223
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.439
He was a guinea pig for the polio vaccine.

224
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.920
We asked ourselves "What walks the most?"

225
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.750
"We?" You're taking credit for this?

226
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.050
The office comes with baggage, Morty.

227
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.319
- Rick, I'm afraid to die! - You won't have to be for long, Morty!

228
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.799
We're due to return to human form any second!

229
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.399
- Then what? - Then we just have to not get eaten

230
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.770
by the spider!

231
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.780
Oh, so in other words, be afraid to die?

232
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.609
Morty, if winning an argument is that important to you,

233
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.623
you were never alive!

234
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.200
Time for a New Deal... Murder!

235
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.620
I'm sick of hearing how iconic you were!

236
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.390
Try having an historical administration

237
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.910
after Facebook goes online, you old-timey bitch!

238
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.820
Morty, tear open that panel!

239
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.080
How's this for a fireside chat?

240
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.640
Woof. You just killed FDR.

241
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.840
He was a monster, though.

242
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.020
Don't mythologize him. He was a politician.

243
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.080
Speaking of, you kind of saved our bacon there,

244
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.120
so I'll make you a deal.

245
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.140
You pardon us and I'll make you human.

246
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.520
Wrong turkey.

247
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.420
Man, the face blindness is real.

248
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.700
I'd like these... men... turned back into humans, please.

249
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.400
Uh, yes, of course, Mr. President.

250
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.620
But I thought we already rehumanized

251
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.041
all the turkified marines.

252
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.940
I'd like these men turned back into humans.

253
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.280
I am the President.

254
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.540
Yes, sir. Uh, sure thing.

255
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.880
Increase their strength by 1,000%.

256
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.120
But... that wouldn't be human.

257
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.020
Turkeys have always been more than human.

258
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.280
Okay, uh, so right there, now I'm starting to...

259
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.960
I am selling New York to France.

260
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.720
And giving all of the money to Congress.

261
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.510
All right, yeah!

262
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.650
Now that's how you do it!

263
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.510
He became President today.

264
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.020
That's right, murmur!

265
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.640
And when you're done, get me some pants.

266
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.220
If you're the President,

267
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.560
who the hell have we been governing the country with

268
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.752
for the last three hours?

269
00:11:06.753 --> 00:11:08.530
An impostor, you good for nothing idiot!

270
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.380
You humanized the wrong turkey!

271
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.700
It's possible.

272
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.000
We shouldn't leave anything to chance.

273
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.930
Wouldn't want Congress working with the wrong president.

274
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.710
A very good point, Mr. President.

275
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.290
Do we believe this fine feathered,

276
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.620
collaborative gentleman to be our commander-in-chief?

277
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.360
Or are we gonna let "Mr. Cash Bar at the Christmas Party"

278
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.390
stay in office?

279
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.020
All in favor of Turkey President?

280
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.180
You can't be serious.

281
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.780
You think he cares about America?

282
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.080
Is that why this is happening to you?

283
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.618
Because you cared about America?

284
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.700
Guards, these men are... oh, what is the word?

285
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.360
Uh, terrorists.

286
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.600
Okay, screw this. Go, Go, Sanchez laser fists.

287
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.250
Oh, [BLEEP], I was a turkey for a while, wasn't I?

288
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.200
Okay, guy's pretty strong.

289
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.220
Mary Todd Lincoln!

290
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.429
Who's dead weight now, bitch?

291
00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:07.144
You should regain feeling in your ass in a minute.

292
00:12:07.145 --> 00:12:09.064
Sorry my turrets blew up your motorcycle.

293
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.800
Just give me some goddamn clothes.

294
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.120
Must suck to have your only safe haven be my house.

295
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.400
Y-You want your regular outfit

296
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.639
- or should we dress you like a terrorist? - I don't need to be here,

297
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.699
and I'm still the President.

298
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.799
Oh, glad to hear it. That means you can give me that pardon.

299
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.339
Or... Or I could put you out with the trash.

300
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.420
What is your problem?! Why do you hate this country?

301
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.169
I hate every country in the universe, brother!

302
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.790
They're job placement programs

303
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.289
for the politicians that invent them...

304
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.610
Okay, Fight Club.

305
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.360
I get paid to protect the sidelines you sit on!

306
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.960
You get paid to make sports metaphors!

307
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.280
I clean your litterbox!

308
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.580
So your little nerd paws don't have to touch

309
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.750
another nerd's nerdy poopies while you're flexing

310
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.740
your grody little edge lord anus all over it!

311
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.300
Guys, maybe you're both right

312
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.859
- and both wrong. - Shut up, Morty!

313
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.240
You little bitch, you destroyed the Constitution.

314
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.649
You're the biggest booger eater here!

315
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.522
Do not talk to my son that way.

316
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.770
Sorry, Mrs. Smith.

317
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.080
The two of you are ruining Thanksgiving. Together.

318
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.699
And you can both either come to the table

319
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.080
and eat food with my family

320
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.760
or you can keep doing what you're doing at the corner bar.

321
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.869
Bars actually suck at Thanksgiving.

322
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.160
I'm still trying to sort through this.

323
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.120
One of you wishes you had the personal quality

324
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.150
known as courage,

325
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.570
but the other two of you want actual vital organs?

326
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.890
This Charlie Kaufman reboot of "Wizard of Oz"

327
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.360
is destroying itself.

328
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.990
That's why I need a brain!

329
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.000
I'm doing a terrible job writing this!

330
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.460
Pass the potatoes.

331
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.500
- Thank you. - Mm-hmm.

332
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.300
Good green beans, Mom.

333
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.440
The turkey's raw, Dad. Shit's potato bunz.

334
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.640
Sorry, Summer, the United States enclosed us

335
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.070
in a shimmer bubble that scrambled my oven timer.

336
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.460
So I guess elections do have consequences.

337
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.220
Eat my ass, Jerry. I've seen your IRS records.

338
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.400
You can blame me once you have taxable income.

339
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.300
Yes, Jerry is a piece of [BLEEP].

340
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.660
I agree.

341
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.600
Um, guys? What's that?

342
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.620
Paula, as you can see, President Curtis has enacted a plan

343
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.280
to turn all turkeys in America

344
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.840
into hybrid super soldiers.

345
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.830
The move has 100% approval from Congress

346
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.960
following its third pay raise in six hours.

347
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.990
Back to you.

348
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.190
My God, the bastard's unhinged!

349
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.080
There won't be a single bird left in DC!

350
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.880
Oh, wow, wiping out a native population on Thanksgiving?

351
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.100
- That's never happened before. - What did you just say?

352
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.200
Well, I-I associated Thanksgiving with genocide.

353
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.550
It's what young people do. I wasn't trying to...

354
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.040
The Crypt of the New World.

355
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.330
That could be our one chance to turn this thing around.

356
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.500
You know about the Crypt?

357
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.180
Ugh, so the treasure's already gone.

358
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.430
Wait, is that why you were stealing the Constitution?

359
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:24.460
You old fart dick.

360
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.560
The Crypt of the New World isn't a treasure.

361
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.920
But it might be our only hope.

362
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.350
- Come on. - But isn't the crypt underneath DC?

363
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.000
The Turkey President's got an army.

364
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.700
An actual Army. And an Air Force.

365
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.979
- And Marines... - Slow down, Morty.

366
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.570
Walk us through every military service.

367
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.600
Does somebody have a pen?

368
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.170
We've got something more powerful

369
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.700
than every army in the world.

370
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.180
Well, no, we don't, but with the right speech,

371
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.989
we could get a handful of well-trained hillbillies.

372
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.700
Eh, it worked against the British. I'm in.

373
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.520
Birds replacin' people.

374
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.080
What would Johnny Cash or Dale Earnhardt say?

375
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.260
He'd say "It's time to walk the line"

376
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.280
or "Drive very fast between two of them."

377
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.100
We don't serve your kind here.

378
00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.550
Oh, my God, are you serious?

379
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.490
- Read the sign. - _

380
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.500
- He's my boss, Marvin. - It's okay.

381
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.990
Mistrusting Presidents is a patriotic duty.

382
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.770
And that guy on TV isn't me.

383
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.880
He's a turkey infused with my DNA.

384
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.913
I'll be damned.

385
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.780
Well, I'm racist.

386
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.200
You better not be here to take my man again.

387
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.680
- Mary Lou. - I'm poor!

388
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.870
And pregnant!

389
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.650
- With a poor person! - And I need you.

390
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.160
And 10% of your baby.

391
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.860
Now, look, I know it's gonna take more than some speech.

392
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.460
But what is a speech?

393
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.280
Isn't it just a question?

394
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.940
And isn't that a question too?

395
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.420
Speeches are words.

396
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.840
Repeated words.

397
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.180
Listed words.

398
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.050
Repeated lists of repeated words.

399
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.460
None of that matters.

400
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.980
You know what does matter?

401
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.640
Me. Asking you. "Will you do what I say?"

402
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.640
Just two questions, Chief.

403
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.900
Lock? And load?

404
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.100
They're rhetorical, sir!

405
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.380
Lock and load!

406
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.190
Lock and load!

407
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.940
Sir, we've got Rick and Morty coming in what appears to be

408
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.920
an unlicensed "Star Wars" AT-AT.

409
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.400
Or as the millennials say, A-T, A-T.

410
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.690
So it begins.

411
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.210
Gobblers! Tonight, we rise!

412
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.140
Aww, geez, geez, geez.

413
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.241
Nice driving, Sanchez.

414
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.909
Wire's down, pen is clear.

415
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.460
You know the goddamn rules!

416
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.969
If you see something clucking or pecking,

417
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.413
put a buckshot in its panties.

418
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.980
Jesus Christ! T-they got Johnson!

419
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.200
He got off easy.

420
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.160
Hold off the bastards!

421
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.500
- What now, Rick? - Time to turn up the broiler.

422
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.820
- Whoa, i-is that... - The Crypt of the New World.

423
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.100
The treasure you were after is this country's oldest secret.

424
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.000
One disguised by centuries of Thanksgiving folklore.

425
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.130
Is that... a turkey dinosaur?

426
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.620
America's original rulers.

427
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.980
Merciless beasts, grazing on the flesh of cowering humans.

428
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.700
Then, in the 15th century, a vessel crashed.

429
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.620
Two vessels, really. On board... our saviors.

430
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.330
Sanchez, pull that lever at the same time I do.

431
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.420
Oh, [BLEEP], they're gonna fight!

432
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.890
No, wait, they love each other!

433
00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.580
They were at war when they arrived,

434
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.100
but they united over their hatred of turkeys.

435
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.120
And what they love even more than each other

436
00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.270
is kicking turkey butt.

437
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.490
Gentlemen! Ba'ruka Dar Tin'in Yo-Tei!

438
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.740
Coooooooooorn!

439
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.280
It's working! Come on, Sanchez,

440
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.080
let's power down the humanizer ray.

441
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.620
- Whose side are we on? - I don't know,

442
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.920
but we've done enough to pay for college.

443
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.930
Look, we're almost there.

444
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.699
Sorry, my turn for a surprise.

445
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.820
Damn, this guy loves arriving from the shadows.

446
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.270
Look around. You can't beat our ancient warriors.

447
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.500
Can't I? My kind has always dealt with predators.

448
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.620
That's why we sleep in trees.

449
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.820
And that's why, in the wild, we fly.

450
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.080
Now you must choose...

451
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.320
Fight me, or stop that weapon from turning all of America's turkeys

452
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.540
into a new master race.

453
00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.989
You dumb dip [BLEEP], there's three of us,

454
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.280
and two of us are spacemen.

455
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.150
Obviously they're gonna save America

456
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.359
and bring that monument home,

457
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.160
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

458
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.460
Oh, and, Sanchez?

459
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.960
- You got your pardon. - Aw.

460
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.820
Shut up, Morty. Come on.

461
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.210
- Let's go, bitch. - So be it.

462
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.020
Is it true what Turkey Man said? That turkeys sleep in trees?

463
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.140
Who the hell cares, Morty?

464
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.839
Let's just deactivate this [BLEEP].

465
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.520
Calibrating.

466
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.875
Targeting all American turkeys.

467
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.380
Oh, my God, they gave it a voice?

468
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.020
Who is this for? We're in space.

469
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.940
- Geez, Rick, I-I-I guess them? - Morty, use this carefully.

470
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.000
Crack the humanizer core and cut the blue wire.

471
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.040
You hear me? Blue wire.

472
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.409
Wha... Why don't we just blow it up?

473
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.960
It's a national monument, [BLEEP] nut!

474
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.989
We just got pardoned.

475
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.010
You really wanna do this again next year?

476
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.320
You forgot something, Turkey Man.

477
00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.775
No matter what you got people to believe,

478
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.090
I'm still the goddamn President.

479
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.260
And you forget, in the one day I've had your job,

480
00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.560
I've learned 10 times as much.

481
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.350
I've underestimated you.

482
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.100
For the last time.

483
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.180
Rick, they're not exactly primary colors!

484
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.290
A-Are... Are we cool with, like, t-turquoise?

485
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.423
Are you kidding me, Morty? Just cut the damn thing!

486
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.508
Oh, shit, oh, [BLEEP]...

487
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.480
Targets acquired. Activating weapon.

488
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.330
Oh, shit! Oooooooh!

489
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.460
Heritage destroyed.

490
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.540
Morty!

491
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.880
God damn it, you had one job!

492
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.100
I beat you.

493
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.190
Look at me, you turkey ass bitch.

494
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.540
Wait, why are you...

495
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.370
- Is that a wishbone? - I wish to explode.

496
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.090
The Berlin Wall has come down.

497
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.419
It's called the Playstation.

498
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.400
The winner is... "Shakespeare in Love."

499
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.020
- Playstation 2. - Hurricane Katrina slams Louisiana...

500
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.969
- Playstation 3. - This is Maroon Five...

501
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.720
- Playstation 4. - The Cubbies win!

502
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.250
I want a Playstation 5.

503
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.699
I wasn't sure when to pull you out.

504
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.639
I-I assumed you were running through your whole life.

505
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.100
Yes.

506
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.196
And what a life it was.

507
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.825
Gentlemen, thank you once again for saving this nation.

508
00:21:21.826 --> 00:21:23.701
Slloosh garg blurrg.

509
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.020
I don't speak googa.

510
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.370
The CIA only taught me your activation phrase.

511
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.780
But if I could say anything...

512
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.770
I'd say give America one more chance.

513
00:21:35.046 --> 00:21:38.549
Kalaak 'ha benben prilo garg.

514
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.600
Oh, my God, they're gonna fight. Th-They're really gonna fight.

515
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.513
Aw, they love each other!

516
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.179
- Never gets old. - I'll never get tired of that.

517
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.790
So... after those aliens discovered America...

518
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.020
They went into hibernation,

519
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.640
leaving us the technology we used to lead the free world.

520
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.720
That and also to do stuff like slavery.

521
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.340
I always thought we were... more special than that.

522
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.079
Like we invented everything and did everything

523
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.580
and that's why we own everything.

524
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.574
Now I-I-I-I don't know what to feel.

525
00:22:02.575 --> 00:22:04.380
Feel thankful, Morty.

526
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.319
Feel thankful.

527
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.960
I know, baby.

528
00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.860
Coop, honey, should we get Lucky Charms or Kibble Bibbitz?

529
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.500
You know we can't afford either.

530
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.340
Baby, the President owes you.

531
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.500
You saved him.

532
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.287
Ain't his fault our insurance got cut.

533
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.370
They gotta build missiles.

534
00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.460
Ugh, fine, just... Can y'all hold Jakey for a second?

535
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.139
What the hell's he doin'?

536
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.309
I think he's foraging.

537
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.120
Crazy bastard thinks he's a turkey.

538
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.210
Well, I refuse to pay for this man's health care.

539
00:23:16.314 --> 00:23:18.066
Did you get any of that?
