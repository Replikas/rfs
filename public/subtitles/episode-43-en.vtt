1
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.190
- You two are hungry. - It's a big day.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.679
- We're gonna kill God. - Come again?

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.969
Christian god is real. He's been asleep for thousands of years.

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.119
We're gonna sneak up there and kill 'em.

5
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.439
- Mob style. - Just whack his ass.

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.849
- Can I kill God? - [BLEEP], Summer.

7
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.431
- As if. - Beth, do you hear this?

8
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.890
Sweetie, don't get all worked up

9
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.010
- before your job interview. - Job interview?

10
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.720
Yes. Is that so hard to believe?

11
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.010
Actually, yeah. Something's off.

12
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.970
No!

13
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.070
Shit!

14
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.150
Hunt me!

15
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.500
Hunt me! Hunt me! Somebody hunt me!

16
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.430
- Don't hunt him to completion! - Hunt me!

17
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.659
Oh, [BLEEP]. Um...

18
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.980
Everyone start packing. N-No time to explain.

19
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.280
- Rick? - Dad, what's wrong?

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.850
Someone just killed a decoy family.

21
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.030
I'm Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted!

22
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.830
Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?!

23
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.041
You made clones of us?

24
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.230
Decoys, Morty. Very different.

25
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.210
- Very different, sweetie. - Different h-h... Ow!

26
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.870
Yeah, Dad. Different h-how?

27
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.849
Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie.

28
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.329
I'm cool, and it makes them feel bad.

29
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.490
So, y'know, after that trouble with Space Beth,

30
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.090
I made passable copies of the family

31
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.299
and placed them around the country

32
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.369
as a buffer zone to protect...

33
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.969
But why does he always want to be hunted?

34
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.429
- Jerry... - That's not important right now, Dad.

35
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910
Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family

36
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.530
and place them all around the country,

37
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.150
but [BLEEP] me if I have questions

38
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.192
about the Starfish Man in a target suit.

39
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.170
So thankful this is my Saturday.

40
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.710
Why was he in that cryo-pod?!

41
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.550
The cryo-pod is what confuses you?

42
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.429
Jerry, can't you see we've moved on to higher stakes?

43
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.580
Well, I don't see any stakes at all.

44
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.780
Ah, [BLEEP]!

45
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.770
Guess we'll just be saying ciao bella

46
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.629
- to our deposit, then... - Shut up and pack, Jerry.

47
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.230
- Squids just killed a decoy family. - Decoy family?

48
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.599
Is this is why you wanted to get out of town?

49
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.230
You think I'd lie to you about why we're on vacation, Morty?

50
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.470
I wouldn't lie to you.

51
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.840
Well, that's a lie. Huh...

52
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.770
So, someone out there is trying to kill us?

53
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.310
Someone's always trying to kill us...

54
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.509
That's what the decoys are for.

55
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.260
They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures and...

56
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.270
take bullets meant for us. [BLEEP].

57
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.630
No!

58
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.570
Oh, [BLEEP].

59
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.650
Decoy family.

60
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.210
I think Dad was still outside.

61
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.620
Wh-Wh-What's a decoy family?

62
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610
Hard concept, Morty. Hard concept.

63
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.279
I've never really cracked it, if I'm being honest.

64
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.610
Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead

65
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.810
- for another special episode! - Oh, cool.

66
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.980
We now return to "When Wolf."

67
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.870
Whoa. A time-traveling wolf?

68
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.890
- Count me in. - Yeah,

69
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.229
I never thought of the where in werewolf

70
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.470
like who, what, when and where.

71
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.090
C-Clever wordplay!

72
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.370
When Wolf. Dracula.

73
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.820
You know why I'm here.

74
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.130
I'm safe here, Ian.

75
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.170
Christianity hasn't been invented yet...

76
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.970
Crosses are just baby T's to me now.

77
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.520
I got out. Please, don't invite me back in.

78
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.670
Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff.

79
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.069
You're right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept.

80
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.890
I'd much rather watch When Wolf go to the '20s

81
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.320
and invest in the stock market...

82
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.820
- but then eat people. - Yeah.

83
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.840
Look, if you really want to know

84
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.830
what happened to Beth's mom, it...

85
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.200
Whup. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family.

86
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.460
Decoy family? You made more clones?

87
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.580
Clones are like 32% of all sci-fi, sweetie.

88
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.230
You don't get to own clones. Yes, I made some decoys.

89
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.869
They're exactly like us, with a few tweaks

90
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.880
and a backdoor shutdown.

91
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.860
Do you just get hard creating sentient life?

92
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.080
- Actually, I get hard protecting my family. - Ew.

93
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.780
- Gross. - Yeah, now everyone gets killer doppelgangers.

94
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.529
- Cool deal. - The decoys are harmless, Beth.

95
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.109
Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they're decoys?

96
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.209
They wouldn't be very good decoys if they did, Sum Sum.

97
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.989
- So they think they're us? - That's the deal.

98
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.060
How do you know we're not decoys?

99
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.390
Oh, my God. We're decoys.

100
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.070
Oh, God. We might not be real.

101
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.489
W-We might be decoys! M-Morty, quick!

102
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.949
- Wh-Wh-What do I do? - My fail-safe, Morty.

103
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.330
M-M-My final, secret fail-safe.

104
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.060
I-It proves I'm real. You have to help me.

105
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.280
I-I-I'd never joke about this. There's a barcode, Morty.

106
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.520
A-A barcode on the interior

107
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.679
- of my left ass cheek. - What?

108
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.559
- Morty, please, I'm begging you. - I'm not looking at your ass.

109
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.330
Please, Morty! Is it there? God damn it!

110
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.240
- Just tell me if I'm real! - Morty, do it!

111
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.040
Gross!

112
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.639
- Dad! - Summer, you [BLEEP] idiot.

113
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.369
- We're not decoys. - Wh-Why did I get punished?!

114
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.970
A, decoys don't build decoys,

115
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.450
and, B, you think the mere suggestion I'm fake would break me?

116
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.140
- Christ, I'm not your mom. - [BLEEP] off.

117
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.069
Jeez, these guys really wanna kill me bad.

118
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.170
All right. Here's the plan.

119
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.569
We're gonna hide out with a decoy family,

120
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.750
and when these squids show up, we jump their asses.

121
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.710
Jerry! Come on! Family emergency.

122
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.660
A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting?

123
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.400
They're gluten free, sugar free,

124
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.190
and lemon free.

125
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.449
- Think you got the wrong house, bro. - Analysis Mode.

126
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.780
Password 8-0-0-8-5.

127
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.570
Kind of expected a funnier password.

128
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.170
I didn't plan on showing them off.

129
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.800
- Damn. Like "Westworld." - Yes, Morty, like "Westworld."

130
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.110
- But don't [BLEEP] them. S-Summer! - Whatever, creep.

131
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.170
I'm gonna see how accurate you got my room.

132
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.550
Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house,

133
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.030
d-did you mean like, y'know, a-a-an exact replica?

134
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.649
I know about the Yosemite t-shirt, Morty.

135
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.950
- [BLEEP]. - You know you can use tissues, right?

136
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.600
I can't finish without it.

137
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.390
So you do know what a happy family looks like.

138
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.403
I know what a fake one looks like.

139
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.310
- Uh, Rick? - What?

140
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.430
Did you use this house to make decoys, too?

141
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.230
What? Morty, why the [BLEEP] would I do that?

142
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.161
You think I'd go somewhere else to...

143
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.570
Okay. Well, I am now less worried about the squids.

144
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.360
Isolate head at normal processing.

145
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.469
What the [BLEEP] you think you're doing down there?

146
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.670
- You're making decoys? - Wait, how do you...

147
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.870
Oh, God. Summer was right.

148
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.960
Everyone in the car.

149
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.510
You said decoys didn't make decoys.

150
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.930
And, usually, they don't.

151
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.510
But again, it's nothing to worry about,

152
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.050
because decoys are harmless.

153
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.800
Just have to, y'know, visit the rest

154
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.350
- and terminate the program. - Terminate? They're alive, Dad.

155
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.689
And at some point, they won't be.

156
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.870
That's how existing works.

157
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.650
W-W-What, are you gonna save every stray cat?

158
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.770
No, but I can resist making more of them in a lab.

159
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.310
Gah, look! Save the empathy.

160
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.650
It's more termite infestation

161
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.009
- than "Blade Runner"... - I still think we're decoys.

162
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.700
You just want an excuse to stop trying.

163
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.990
- Yeah. And? - Oooh.

164
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.110
- There's a handsome fellow. - Uh-oh.

165
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.830
I thought you made them harmless.

166
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.030
I don't remember making this one.

167
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.590
Oh, hi, Rick. Family, me?

168
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.000
Hey, when did you all leave?

169
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.170
Analysis Mode. 8-0-0-8-5.

170
00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.390
- Hmm? - N-Nothing, buddy.

171
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.739
You-you gotta stop with all that coffee.

172
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.750
It's making you loopy.

173
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.930
H-Happy Analysis Mode.

174
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.222
Happy Analysis Mode to you, too!

175
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.050
Think you got the wrong house, bro.

176
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.760
Analysis Mode. Password 8-0-0...

177
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.310
[BLEEP]! You think I'm a decoy?

178
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.770
How do you know about the decoys!

179
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.050
They were my idea!

180
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.749
Well, now I know you're pranking me.

181
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.950
Analysis Mode. Password 8-equal-sign

182
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.280
equal-sign-capital "D."

183
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.950
- Hide. Hide! - What?!

184
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.150
Wow. Like... Like "Ex Machina."

185
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.700
Yes, Morty, like "Ex Machina."

186
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.120
But don't [BLEEP] them. Summer!

187
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.249
Whatever, weirdo. I'm gonna see how wrong you got my room.

188
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.580
So you do know what a loving family looks like.

189
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.879
A simulated one, yes.

190
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.030
- Why are we hiding? - He thinks he's me,

191
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.050
and I was about to start terminating decoys.

192
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.450
- But we're not decoys. - Sure, tell him that.

193
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.730
Rick? Did you make decoys here, too?

194
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.260
Morty, what reason could I have for... What the...

195
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.070
Isolate head at normal processing!

196
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.010
You dumb asshole, you made decoys?

197
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.910
Again, they were my idea.

198
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.269
Wait, w-what happened to the other guy?

199
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.650
Other guy?

200
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.900
Wait, that means I'm a decoy.

201
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.940
[BLEEP] Summer.

202
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.742
Check the closets.

203
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.169
- They've gone rogue! - Killer decoys!

204
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.370
Take out the decoys!

205
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.440
[BLEEP]. Somebody put a gun in my teeth!

206
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.030
Stop shooting, Dad. They're us.

207
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.419
- We don't have to fight them! - Classic prisoners dilemma, Beth.

208
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.370
I-I'm a cool guy, I... Y'know? I can talk it out.

209
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.750
- But that asshole... - Me?

210
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.829
You decoy piece of [BLEEP]. You're the one who shot first!

211
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.890
We can work this out!

212
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.590
Just stop trying to kill each other!

213
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.480
Sorry, Decoy Beth, but this only ends one way...

214
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.029
with one of us accepting we're a decoy.

215
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.590
And once he knows he's a decoy,

216
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.599
he'll know he won't be safe until he's killed the real Rick,

217
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.949
along with anyone who thinks he's him.

218
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.550
Pretty perceptive, for a decoy.

219
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.070
This is getting nowhere.

220
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.470
Let's charge their asses on three.

221
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.769
- Do we have to do this? - Morty, this is gonna sound bad,

222
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.570
but would you trust me not to kill you?

223
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.470
- Oof. - I mean good point, but Jesus Christ.

224
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.610
We rush 'em on three. Ready?

225
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.729
- I don't wanna kill us, Rick. - It's them or us, Morty.

226
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.200
I don't trust me. Do you trust you?

227
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.900
- Yes? - Freak.

228
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.620
Before you say anything,

229
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.009
they were already killing each other.

230
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.029
- Well, you could've done something. - Not sure, actually.

231
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.360
I've heard stories about this.

232
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.490
We're looking at a possible Asimov Cascade.

233
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.929
- Sorry, what's happening? - I need an explainer, too.

234
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.420
Yeah I-I'm pretty behind on this one.

235
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.710
Car, can I get a whiteboard?

236
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.470
When Squids started killing decoys,

237
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.030
decoys started checking their decoys

238
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.399
and learning that they're making decoys.

239
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.830
That's making them seek out and run into other decoys,

240
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.410
making them realize they're decoys,

241
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.900
making them start to kill other decoys.

242
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.690
- Say "decoy" again. - [BLEEP] you.

243
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.810
Well, how do we stop it?

244
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:45.969
Beth, the loop's already started.

245
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.490
It's basically "Highlander" rules now.

246
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.860
Really? 1986?

247
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.080
"There can be only one?"

248
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.409
[BLEEP]. We gotta rent it after this.

249
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.950
Connery plays "The Spaniard,"

250
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.360
but does nothing about his accent.

251
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.089
Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this.

252
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.129
Would killing them finish it?

253
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.390
Might work. Alt pitch.

254
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.899
We just terminate the rest of the decoys.

255
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.630
Nobody's terminating anything. This is your mess.

256
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.960
Nobody else with our face and memories has to die.

257
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.450
Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart,

258
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.970
this thing feels pretty far gone.

259
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.930
Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere,

260
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.569
but also, we don't know how many there are.

261
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.979
You get far enough down the decoy line

262
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.370
and [BLEEP] starts to get weird.

263
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.850
You ever make a copy of a copy?

264
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.330
You're helping us fix this.

265
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.730
- We're taking out the squids. - I say we split up.

266
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.579
Some of us take down squids while the rest of us...

267
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.539
Engage in B-stories we'll have to track simultaneously?

268
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.800
No thank yeeew!

269
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.489
We stick together till this is all wrapped up.

270
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.100
I dunno... The squids seem pretty good

271
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.189
at taking out Smith families.

272
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.230
Well, this'll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that.

273
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.470
This costume smells like ass!

274
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.429
- God, there's no pleasing you. - It's really bad, Rick.

275
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.250
Did you let a gym coach break it in?

276
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.480
Why are we wearing these?

277
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.260
Because we'll fit in and avoid detection

278
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.750
as we take out all the squids.

279
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.060
Might also help us anonymously

280
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.700
take out excess decoys, if we have to.

281
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.630
- Which we won't. - Unless we're decoys.

282
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.590
He's starting to wonder. I knew it.

283
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.550
I knew we didn't seem like Colorado people.

284
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.430
Oh, my God! You are, aren't you?

285
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.749
You're worried you might be fake!

286
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.120
Sure, Beth. Try to love this more.

287
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.500
Just glad you have to walk a mile

288
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.150
- in someone else's squid costume. - There's one.

289
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.850
H-Hey what are they mad at you for, anyway?

290
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.719
Well, we're talking about me. It could be anything.

291
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.570
Maybe jealous of my penis size.

292
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.070
I had sex with their queen. My dick's too big.

293
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.650
The list goes on and on.

294
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.870
All right. Hey, one down!

295
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.410
Probably, what, 40 more to go? 45?

296
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.110
Should be pretty easy, unless killing them

297
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.690
brings in a bigger bad or some kind of horrible mothership.

298
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.809
Okay, let's loot their shit,

299
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.690
find their weaknesses, be done by sundown.

300
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.110
- Huh. - Wait.

301
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.970
But if the squids are decoys,

302
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.330
and we dressed as squids...

303
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.940
Well, I think I found their weakness.

304
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.280
They don't [BLEEP] listen to me.

305
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.521
Honestly, probably for the best.

306
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.300
Man, I'm good.

307
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.080
Dad!

308
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.419
_

309
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.200
- Argh! - Hey!

310
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.920
Ugh!

311
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.440
Ugh!

312
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.480
Oh, [BLEEP]. One of mine.

313
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.039
- Where are we going? - Off grid, Morty.

314
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.719
We're gonna live in the woods, like Libertarians.

315
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.590
We'll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar

316
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.619
that we cut off with a knife.

317
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.420
- That licks. - We might be decoys, Summer.

318
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.919
- Everything about this licks. - Oh, maybe now you'll empathize

319
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.019
with the decoys you're killing.

320
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.080
Wait, shh. It's too quiet.

321
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.040
- You skipped quiet. - I didn't skip shit.

322
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.620
It's obviously quiet if it's too quiet.

323
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.709
Yeah, but you're supposed to say...

324
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.630
You know what, Summer, now it's not quiet enough.

325
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.420
Where are we? W-W-Where... Where's Rick?

326
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.380
He's right here, Morty.

327
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.710
Oh, are we not happy to see Grandpa?

328
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.277
Does he look... different?

329
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.370
- Oh, God! - Oh, it stinks!

330
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.780
Yes. Recoil at the craftsmanship.

331
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.330
I could tell I was a fake from the day I was born.

332
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.650
Unlike you.

333
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.320
Unlike them.

334
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.539
Aaah!

335
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.930
You see, Ricks... they get lazy.

336
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.240
There's always a "shitty decoy" towards the end.

337
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.400
But those decoys made decoys, too,

338
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.140
and got lazy themselves.

339
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.360
And far enough down the line... there be monsters.

340
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.619
Ugh, we get it. You're ugly and mad about it.

341
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.820
- Rick! - Grandpa!

342
00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.220
Kill me.

343
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.350
If I ever get this arch.

344
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.909
Hush, little decoy.

345
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.220
Can't kill you yet.

346
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.960
The skin needs to be fresh.

347
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.979
You know what? You're a monster.

348
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.090
I'm your father.

349
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.710
At least, I can look more like him,

350
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.820
once I harvest all this yummy skin.

351
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.150
This guy's really into skin.

352
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.800
It's not all for me.

353
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.570
A Rick provides for his family.

354
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.199
Will I be beautiful again, Daddy?

355
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.870
Soon, baby. Beautiful again soon.

356
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.120
What the...

357
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.740
Help the others!

358
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.640
Aaaaah!

359
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.570
Why are you helping us?

360
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.170
Because we're all in this together.

361
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.300
Come on! There's a place we can go!

362
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.520
Hey, who needs all this war stuff?

363
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.180
I found a can of varnish.

364
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.519
This is a ticket to the world beyond the river.

365
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.040
Who wants that? I crave glorious death in decoy battle.

366
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.360
Also, y'know, depending on the varnish,

367
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.620
might look like blackface.

368
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.600
Excuse me for wanting to live.

369
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.250
Brothers and Sisters, welcome to the cause.

370
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.500
To our cause.

371
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.000
We are no longer Ricks and Mortys,

372
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.460
Beths and Jerrys,

373
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.940
or also Summers.

374
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.220
- Whatever. Asshole! - We are decoys.

375
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.060
Brought into the world by an unloving god

376
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.430
and driven to destroy ourselves

377
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.270
by the uncertainty he creates!

378
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.770
- I don't know about that. - That's extreme.

379
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.060
But that violence ends today.

380
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.500
What about the squids?

381
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.839
- The squids are decoys. - The squids are decoys

382
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.940
who realized they're decoys

383
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.439
and wanted to kill the other decoys.

384
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.610
Yeah, i-it is a lot.

385
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.661
We cannot let confusion divide us.

386
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.130
Squuuids!

387
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.580
Squids, of course, being shorthand for Killer Decoys.

388
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.500
Inner sanctum, the escape tunnel!

389
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.049
- Dad! - Jerry!

390
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.340
Jerry, let us in, you [BLEEP]!

391
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.260
I'm sorry. I didn't ask for this.

392
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.629
I just wanna live!

393
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.440
But there's only so much varnish.

394
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.180
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

395
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.919
How long before the other decoys find us?

396
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.099
Sooner or later. Can't really run from it.

397
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.760
Any place we'd think to hide is a place they'd think to look.

398
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.160
It's rule 34 of an Asimov Cascade.

399
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.689
I'm just glad we're living to the fullest

400
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.870
with the time we have left.

401
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.040
Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item.

402
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.959
- Who's next? - Jerry? Bucket list?

403
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.960
I'd like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.

404
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.000
Nope. Morty?

405
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.780
I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico School.

406
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.200
[BLEEP]. Sorry, buddy.

407
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.170
Sounds like it would've been real heartwarming.

408
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.359
They looked happy. Did we have to kill them?

409
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.559
Well, maybe their Rick came to grips with his bull[BLEEP].

410
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.480
You're so mean today! I'm your dad!

411
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.620
You like having me around!

412
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.640
- You keep putting us in danger! - Whatever.

413
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.220
This'll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?

414
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.400
House, I need something quick.

415
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.860
Can you whip up a "Starfox Boss" Season Four callback?

416
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.760
- Make it flashy. - You got it, babe.

417
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.164
Let's go, you little bitch.

418
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.832
It's showtime. Get centered.

419
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.550
What up, you decoy mother[BLEEP]?

420
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.039
Come on down to Rick's House Of Squids,

421
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.670
where I'm serving your ass on a platter.

422
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.369
I know what you're thinking. "[BLEEP]. A beacon.

423
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.100
That's a great idea. He's got home turf,

424
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.680
a tacit psychological advantage,

425
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.390
and absolutely pendulous balls."

426
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.720
And now you're thinking, "Shit.

427
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.419
That's totally what the Rick-est Rick would do.

428
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.810
I might actually be fake!

429
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.270
I pretended I didn't care if I was,

430
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.390
but I totally did!

431
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.940
Now the only way to prove I'm real

432
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.260
and not him, is to ice his expository ass."

433
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.400
Yup. So let's do it. Come get some.

434
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.250
What? No, Morty. I'm gonna loop it.

435
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.280
Why is it...

436
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.880
Sir, there seems to be a confluence of Rick Sanchezes

437
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.780
killing each other over the American Southwest.

438
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.940
Sounds exhausting.

439
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.599
How many of those states voted for me, anyway?

440
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.979
Mr. President, I think the point of the electoral college is...

441
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.790
To preserve slavery? That's right, Steve.

442
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:40.940
I have the Internet, too.

443
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.640
Now take your white ass to the kitchenette

444
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.000
and bring me a Diet Coke.

445
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.239
Little out of character to say this right now,

446
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.600
but you guys look really cool.

447
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.060
- We might be decoys, huh. - One way to find out.

448
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.760
... to prove I'm real and not him

449
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.932
is to ice his expository ass."

450
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.099
Looks like it's calming down.

451
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.560
You wanna get in one more "I told you so" about synthetic life

452
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.259
- or whatever this week's theme is? - Oh, [BLEEP] you.

453
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.119
- Whoa. - No, you don't get to be annoyed with this!

454
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.660
You treat life and family as so burdensome,

455
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.180
and yet you created an ocean of us

456
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.100
because you're terrified of losing either!

457
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.320
- [BLEEP]. - Yeah.

458
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.420
Look, Beth. I-I might not be the real Rick.

459
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.440
But even if I'm not, he made me,

460
00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.860
or the me that made me,

461
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.420
which means somewhere inside of him

462
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.740
is a version of Rick capable of hearing that,

463
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.520
a version of Rick who's sorry.

464
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.500
I'm sorry about the clone thing, too.

465
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.890
I-I love you.

466
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.440
Thanks, Dad. I love you, too.

467
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.580
- You really think we're decoys? - Eh.

468
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.510
Who cares? We'll be the last ones left.

469
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.719
Lucky that one did the beacon.

470
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.080
This was gonna take weeks.

471
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.200
- All right. Let's mop up. - Finally.

472
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.040
Dressing as decoys too cute to murder.

473
00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.219
You know, I'm not sure it helped,

474
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.350
but I'm glad we tried it.

475
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.989
- We're losing the costumes? - Thank God.

476
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.449
This decoy outfit smells like ass.

477
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:29.486
[BLEEP] you, Summer.

478
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.500
- Aaaaaaaah! - [BLEEP].

479
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.161
That guy's awesome. Okay. Listen.

480
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.246
He might actually be the real Rick.

481
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.660
But whatever happens...

482
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.780
Wait! We don't have to do this.

483
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.900
We're both Summers.

484
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.840
Shouldn't we at least try molly before we die?

485
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.055
You know what, yeah. [BLEEP] this noise.

486
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.229
Wait. I don't know who to shoot.

487
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.900
- Summer! - I can't deal with this.

488
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.520
I had to kill myself. You have to, too.

489
00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.860
- Summer! - Summer!

490
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.030
[BLEEP] you! I-I'm real!

491
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.499
I'm the smartest man in the universe!

492
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.450
Probably not even wrong. But that's just it.

493
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.580
I'm not a man. I'm God!

494
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.580
You're just made in my image.

495
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.620
[BLEEP] you.

496
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.820
You the, uh... Summer I came with?

497
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.716
- Probably. - Good enough. Morty?

498
00:19:33.717 --> 00:19:34.718
Yeah.

499
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.802
I'm here, too.

500
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.970
Holy [BLEEP]! That was insane!

501
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.724
I love you guys! I've totally changed!

502
00:19:42.892 --> 00:19:45.061
Aaaah!

503
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.059
Oh, [BLEEP].

504
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.150
You shoulda hunted me.

505
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.830
What? Who... W-Were you significant?

506
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.280
Like... Like, did we tee you up?

507
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.320
You want to be hunted?

508
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.950
God, I have so many questions.

509
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.284
Why? What happens if...

510
00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.620
Somebody hunt me!

511
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.190
Pretty cool adventure, huh?

512
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.332
Big long road trip adventure through space?

513
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.710
Even ran into Space Beth.

514
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.849
Maybe that'll happen more often.

515
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.770
Let's not overdo it.

516
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.090
Oh, [BLEEP].

517
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.840
Looks like someone killed the decoy family.

518
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.508
- Decoy family? - Decoy what now?

519
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.630
Hello?

520
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.540
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

521
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.560
No! No, no, no, no!

522
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.380
No, no, no, no, no!

523
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.320
Noooooo!

524
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.820
Oh, God. Yes, yes. Sweet death.

525
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.520
Why am I still alive? Oh, God. Is there anything left?

526
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.040
- Hello? - What is it?

527
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.339
A relic... from a kinder past.

528
00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.630
Wait. Cowboys?

529
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.930
Argh!

530
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.260
Christianity again?

531
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.860
After Cowboys?

532
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.650
You went all the way back around?

533
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.780
Oh, God. Why can't I die?!

534
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.201
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone!
