1
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.770
Ah! Now, that was some fantastic chow mein.

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.470
And before you say that sounded racist,

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.220
you can ask the waiter how they say it.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.840
It's Panda Express, honey. The waiter's from Portland.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.620
All right, who the hell changed my ringtone

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.840
to the theme from "Taxi"?

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.340
It's a new thing on Taxi Tok.

8
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.910
That's a subculture on TikTok of kids

9
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.720
who decided the theme from "Taxi" slaps.

10
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.079
Now you have to play the "Taxi" theme

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.450
for ten people while I film it.

12
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.180
I don't have to do shit. That's dumb.

13
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.440
It raises awareness for leukemia.

14
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.720
So... who else is excited for the zoo tomorrow?

15
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.130
Zoos are my favorite kind of non-water park.

16
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.240
It's just a shame that they both give you diarrhea.

17
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.120
You only get diarrhea at the zoo if you eat the food

18
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.740
you're supposed to feed to the animals.

19
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.370
Which you've done, twice.

20
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.500
They put it in gumball machines.

21
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.360
You know, fortune cookies only come true

22
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.302
if you eat the cookie first.

23
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.264
All right. "Hard work often pays off"? Lame.

24
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.140
"Family time is time well spent."

25
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.311
Okay, that's not only empty. It's been disproven.

26
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.760
Okay, mine says, "Family time is time well... "

27
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.106
Oh, man, I got the same one?

28
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.120
- Boo. - Boo.

29
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.680
What's your stupid 21-century watered-down fortune cookie say, Dad?

30
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.280
"You will have sex with your mother."

31
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.780
Fortune cookies aren't legitimate, right?

32
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.460
Jerry, are you seriously asking

33
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.179
if I think you're gonna have sex with your mom?

34
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
No, I-I wanted to ask if it's okay with you

35
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
if I make myself throw up the cookie.

36
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.180
If it makes you feel better and you can do it quietly, yes,

37
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260
but don't hand that advice down to Summer.

38
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.200
Ugh! Can't do it.

39
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.440
Sleepy Gary ruined my gag reflex,

40
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.940
which is frustrating because Sleepy Gary wasn't real.

41
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.900
Neither are fortune cookies. Go to sleep, Jerry.

42
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.690
I know they're not real.

43
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.640
It's just... why is it so specific?

44
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.659
And why are three of the numbers

45
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.670
a few numbers off from my Mom's birthday?!

46
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.160
Can we investigate this, Rick?

47
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.440
It's not an X-File, Jerry.

48
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.640
You got the world's last interesting fortune.

49
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.400
Dad, can you explain to TikTok what's going on with your mom?

50
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.980
Summer, no social videoing! What if Mi-Maw sees it?

51
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.260
We can't let her know this is a thing that might happen!

52
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Uh, "might"?

53
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.319
She's calling again.

54
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.820
She doesn't usually call this much.

55
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.880
Because you don't usually ghost her

56
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
because you don't usually decide you're at risk of...

57
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.709
What if she's calling me to tell me I'm adopted?!

58
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.140
Well, yeah, then you should definitely hit that.

59
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.280
That's not funny!

60
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.400
Jerry, you're making it funny by taking it seriously.

61
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.180
And none of us will be laughing if you let this ruin our zoo trip.

62
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.560
Rick, can you use science to make it impossible for me to...

63
00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.940
Jerry, you're insulting science.

64
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.480
And as the most powerful man in the universe,

65
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.890
if I create technology to prevent a random occurrence,

66
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.980
I'll end up making it more possible than random.

67
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.240
- _ - When do we leave for the zoo?

68
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.100
One hour. You have one hour to let go of this.

69
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.070
I'm already done thinking about it.

70
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.410
Check that out, huh?

71
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.140
Ah!

72
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.583
Ah! No!

73
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.045
Aah! Aah! Aah!

74
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.090
Let me out! Let me out!

75
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.020
- You have ten seconds. - I want to go.

76
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.660
You know of my love for the zoo!

77
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.010
Why are you dressed like Morty?

78
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.880
Because Morty's mom is Beth.

79
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.601
I'm not unpacking that.

80
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.160
Okay, if you think I have this much patience for the zoo,

81
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.230
on Earth, you're sorely mistaken.

82
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.200
Jerry, if you don't come with us, I will be so disappointed.

83
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.959
Okay, you guys should probably go on without Jerry.

84
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.160
I just took some readings on his probability field,

85
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.900
and this fortune has some strange powers

86
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.459
- I'm gonna need to investigate. - Really?!

87
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.600
- Oh, God, I knew it. - Okay.

88
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.060
- Well, be careful, honey. - Ooh!

89
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.619
Bring me back a handful of zebra snacks?

90
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.040
A-And please take pictures with my favorite animal, the white tiger!

91
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.450
- Because they breed via incest? - Is that true?!

92
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.216
- Ah. I knew I was right. - Not even close.

93
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.960
I just didn't want to see someone get bullied into going to a zoo.

94
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.219
You may be the single dumbest human I've ever met, Jerry,

95
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.260
but you still have a right to take whatever you want seriously.

96
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.159
Thank you, but if that thing says I'm not gonna do it with my mom,

97
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.170
I can go to the zoo.

98
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.920
Jerry, this thing measures aberrations in probability waves.

99
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.270
I didn't even bother to turn it on because if I did...

100
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.640
- Huh. - What?!

101
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.380
Nothing. Don't get weird on me.

102
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.390
But, uh, since we're free for the afternoon,

103
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.157
you mind doing a quick activity?

104
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.480
We're gonna disprove this with efficient brute force.

105
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.360
These are two shoeboxes. Both are empty,

106
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.299
but I wrote your mother's name on the inside of one.

107
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.100
What? God, no! If you think for a second I'm gonna put my...

108
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.940
Good. I didn't wanna do this anyway.

109
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.505
Fine! Can I just tell you which box I would put my penis in?

110
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.258
Saying it seems worse, but okay.

111
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.427
All right. I would put my penis in the box on the right.

112
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.979
Great. Uh, look in the other direction,

113
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.660
and I'm gonna switch up the boxes.

114
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.960
This feels really low-tech.

115
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.900
Yeah, 'cause we're measuring reality.

116
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.110
I would take out my penis

117
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.310
and place it in the box on the... right.

118
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.941
Again.

119
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.570
I would put my penis...

120
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.309
Jerry, you don't have to say "penis" every time.

121
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.600
- Just left or right. - Hey, this was your idea!

122
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.320
I didn't think it'd go on this long.

123
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.060
Okay, penis. Ugh! Left!

124
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.420
- Keep going. - Right.

125
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.110
Left. Right.

126
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.600
Jerry, are you fucking peeking?

127
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.340
Tell me what's going on! You're scaring me!

128
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.520
Okay, I'm just as likely to shit a balloon

129
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.670
as I am to become a dolphin.

130
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.839
Those are things that could happen?

131
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.950
Jerry, everything is as likely as anything else.

132
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.220
Which is why it's weird that you're at all likely to...

133
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.950
To what? To what?!

134
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.600
Jerry, has your mother been leaving messages?

135
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.200
Three texts. I'm afraid to read them.

136
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.660
Read them.

137
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.700
She's asking if she can come visit.

138
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.360
Why would she want that?!

139
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.024
Jerry, I'm gonna tell you something I've never told anyone.

140
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.076
We need to go to Panda Express.

141
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.019
If these guys wanted my respect,

142
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.589
they could've just gotten a liquor license.

143
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.620
Now you think this has something to do with you?

144
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.380
Jerry, whoever's behind that fortune has, like, god powers.

145
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.040
Of course it has something to do with me.

146
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.881
What do you think I am in this story, the father-in-law?

147
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.100
You guys wanted my attention?

148
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.769
Okay, well, now I'm getting mixed signals.

149
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.850
- _ - Gah!

150
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.100
Stay here, Jerry.

151
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.260
Time to kick ass.

152
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.520
Gonna need a soundtrack.

153
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.857
Ship, favorites playlist, track one.

154
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.840
All right, fine. No wrong answers.

155
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.340
Tell me where you get your cookies at,

156
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.149
- and we can all walk out of here alive! - Fuck you, DEA piece of shit!

157
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.489
- DEA? - Cookies?

158
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.679
- Fortune cookies. - You're not here

159
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.149
about our gang's city-wide meth ring?

160
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.990
What? No. Break the laws. They shouldn't exist anyway.

161
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.400
Yeah. Wow. I am embarrassed.

162
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.660
Aw, me too. Sorry about, uh, these dead guys.

163
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.100
Comes with the territory.

164
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.200
So w-where do you get your cookies?

165
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.000
Same distributor as everyone else. That's their truck out back.

166
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.580
Solid. Okay, I'm gonna take the truck

167
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.365
in exchange for not turning you in.

168
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.880
Geez. How much money can there be

169
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.291
in cookies that you get for free?

170
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.640
And now we're being retina scanned?

171
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.970
Oh, oh, oh! I know!

172
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.910
- I've got a theory, Jerry. - Oh, good.

173
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.900
This place is run by Cookie Monster.

174
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.180
He's really protective about his cookies.

175
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.080
C'mon, man. You can't crack a smile?

176
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.089
Oh, yeah... you're worried about doing it with your mom.

177
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.260
Okay. Fair enough.

178
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.460
Whoa!

179
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.000
Fucking cameras everywhere. That cup is a camera.

180
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.817
That tree is a camera.

181
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.100
Can you disable them?

182
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.540
Stealth rule number one... turning off 300 cameras

183
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.947
draws more attention than changing outfits.

184
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.284
Looks like we need to dress for success.

185
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.740
Eye of Thundara, give me suits beyond suits!

186
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.370
Jerry, assistant clothing. MAKE-UP!

187
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.620
What the hell was that?

188
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.140
Reuseable "Sailor Moon" sequence.

189
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.259
If we ever need to show you becoming my assistant again,

190
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.020
we can repeat it and save lots of money.

191
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.650
Why does an operation bigger than the government

192
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.300
want me to... couple with my mother?

193
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.583
Whoa. Bezos? Bill Gates? Prime ministers?

194
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.668
Weirdly, Billy Zane is also here.

195
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.547
Hello. You're about to meet me, Jennith Padrow-Chunt.

196
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.360
15 years ago, I was living in my parents' garage,

197
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.762
eating ramen out of a toilet when I discovered something.

198
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.620
Fate isn't fiction.

199
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.470
Everything you want can be yours, if you ask for it.

200
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.220
Just ask me.

201
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.060
- Hello, me. - Hello, me.

202
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.400
Look at Me's.

203
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.524
Every suit I wear is virgin white.

204
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.350
I sleep on a bed of loose grains

205
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.080
and begin every morning by dragging my perfect vagina

206
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.820
across Chinese silver grass.

207
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.640
I'm firm and ripe.

208
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.080
My mother's plane just landed.

209
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.490
She took a photo at the airport

210
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.996
in front of that Wolfgang Puck that smells like a kindergarten.

211
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.159
Want to know the secret

212
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.333
- to how I changed my future? - Yes.

213
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.380
Well, once you're a level seven investor,

214
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.045
you'll learn that and more.

215
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.500
Yeah, we're not getting the answers we want here.

216
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.174
Let's go deeper.

217
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.040
And now, thanks to your generous contributions,

218
00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.800
here are this year's cookies.

219
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.040
"You will receive a 6.8% year-on-year increase."

220
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.660
- Very nice. - "Your talents are appreciated... "

221
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.280
"... when you become junior partner."

222
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.490
Holy shit! I'm going to be on "Dancing with the Stars"!

223
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.550
Please, I can get the money. I swear!

224
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.440
- Gak! - I'm afraid it's too late for that.

225
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.000
Oh, God, what does it say?

226
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.730
"Your penis will be mangled

227
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.380
by a frozen-yogurt machine at the U.N."?

228
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.660
I know that machine!

229
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.420
This would sound impossible to a layman,

230
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.212
but to me it rings inevitable!

231
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.740
Holy shit. This is real.

232
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.360
- They're controlling fate for profit. - I'm glad you're happy.

233
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.640
Now can we blow up the building or something?

234
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.039
I don't think that's the best way to take away their power, Jerry.

235
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.159
Let's take it in a way that ends with us having it.

236
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.520
You mean you having it.

237
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.320
- I'll share it. - Then you fuck my mom.

238
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.880
That's not how it works, and I already have.

239
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.524
- What?! - Jesus, Jerry, come on.

240
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.240
How unfortunate.

241
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.696
Use the emergency fortunes!

242
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.365
Fighting fortunes. T-T-They're leveling up!

243
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.702
"You'll have great success in a fight."

244
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.080
I'll be damned.

245
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.374
Ha!

246
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.160
Yah!

247
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.378
Fuck! This both sucks

248
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.910
and is really valuable data.

249
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.820
- Ha! - Oh!

250
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.659
Aah! Wha! Rick, what are you doing?!

251
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.540
- Using you as a human shield. - You said it!

252
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.620
You said the thing I thought you were doing.

253
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.500
We've got intruders.

254
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.940
And one of them... has an unresolved fortune.

255
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.648
_

256
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.130
We need that man's mother.

257
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.010
Lot of mothers in the world, ma'am.

258
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.300
But only one of them is Mrs....

259
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.770
ugh, God damn it... Smith?

260
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.622
So are we going to ignore that you tried to stop bullets

261
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.790
using my body?

262
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.039
You have an unresolved fortune.

263
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.420
Until you have sex with your mom, you're basically immortal.

264
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.490
Do you have any idea how amazing that is?

265
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.080
You don't even care about me.

266
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.498
You just want fortune cookie power.

267
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.370
Okay, Jerry, how 'bout this?

268
00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.620
If it comes down to it,

269
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.370
I promise I'll put a bullet in her head.

270
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.980
- No! - Ah, you're right.

271
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.729
The fortune didn't say she'd be alive, did it?

272
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.540
- I hate you! - Hate productive things.

273
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.540
Hate crawling through a fucking air vent.

274
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.660
Ah, those are those weird hex-headed screws.

275
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.859
Do your screwdriver fingers...

276
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.400
Aah! Aah!

277
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.590
Well, at least we have no idea what's going on.

278
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.610
That's a LOCKER-ean. I-It's a species that eats chaos.

279
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.520
But it has its digestive disorder.

280
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.610
Its stomach is stripping randomness from spacetime

281
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.540
and leaving behind super-dense pockets of energy

282
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.950
that bend entropy towards definable outcomes.

283
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.460
I mean, th-that's how fate works.

284
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.685
It's a field, like gravity,

285
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.440
but instead of pulling small toward big,

286
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.940
it pulls unknown toward known.

287
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.820
Ah, so we do know what's going on.

288
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.859
We know this... everyone that's had a fortune cookie

289
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.160
in the last 20 years has eaten this thing's poop.

290
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.080
Fortune cookies are alien poop.

291
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.860
These fortunes are so basic.

292
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.120
Why wouldn't you use this power to change the world?

293
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.880
Or at least get Nintendo to make a portable VR headset?

294
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.400
Ooh, this place ain't for creatin' the future,

295
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.870
but controllin' it.

296
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.710
Hi, I'm Old. Old M. Hucksbee.

297
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.740
The "M" stands for "Man."

298
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.420
You're an arch little character.

299
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.060
You're the reason fortune cookies suck?

300
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.100
No, no, no, that's Jenneth Chunt's idea.

301
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.550
You have to glut the marketplace with pointless fortunes

302
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.380
to increase the value of real ones.

303
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.480
Controlling destiny for a price...

304
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.519
that's the Fortune 500's fortune.

305
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.500
And you're trying to stop them?

306
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.780
Just tryin' to get out.

307
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.320
I want to be free with this here alien gal

308
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.760
so we can get married.

309
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.520
Then we can have relations.

310
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.680
Can't do that before marriage, you know.

311
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.939
I'm a Catholic.

312
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.440
Uh, does the alien want that?

313
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.040
It's not exactly what I'd call a sentient species.

314
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.080
A man knows.

315
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.940
What does this have to do with me?

316
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.880
You put this in my cookie.

317
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.960
Yep. Oh, I've been tryin' to get people's attention.

318
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.700
I'd make fortunes saying, "You're a-gonna break your leg

319
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.920
unless you investigate this cookie company,"

320
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.640
or, "Please come help me

321
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.680
or a virus will shut down the world."

322
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.680
Finally I just made a bunch that said,

323
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.307
"You're gonna have sex with your own momma."

324
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.559
How many? It... What happened to the others?

325
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.410
I 'spose they fucked their moms.

326
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.080
Now let's cut her chains and get the hell outta here.

327
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.190
Well, shit on a spaghetti.

328
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.653
Hello, Jerry Smith.

329
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.656
Glad you could join us on Bring Your Mother to Work day.

330
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.282
- Mom! - Hi, Jerry.

331
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.400
Your friends picked me up in a limousine.

332
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.459
They said you won something,

333
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.120
and I should be the one to give it to you.

334
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.666
- You sick fucks. - Are you guys enjoying this?

335
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.640
I used to think I was just a regular white woman.

336
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.380
Then I discovered I could control my destiny.

337
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.780
All white women think that.

338
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.920
The truth is, this alien crashed in your yard

339
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.218
and you ate its shit.

340
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.928
How dare you! What's your name?

341
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.330
How dare you?!

342
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.764
We should've blown up the building.

343
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.460
Doesn't matter. All I was gonna say is,

344
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.340
"Guess what, insert name? Time for you to eat shit."

345
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.020
- But first... - Aah!

346
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.040
Oh, no!

347
00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.360
- I'm so wet! - Ah!

348
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.484
- No! - Jerry! Come back and block bullets.

349
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.903
Authorizing the use of prototype fortunes.

350
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.328
- Fuck! - You can't hide!

351
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.622
My fortune said, "Headshots only."

352
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.340
Harry! Greg! Lashawn! Dave C.! Dave M.! Noooo!

353
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.004
You piece of shit, you killed my friends.

354
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.547
Oh!

355
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.592
All right, what does the future hold?

356
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.260
_

357
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.050
Aah!

358
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.100
- _ - Maybe I can PokÃ©mon this shit.

359
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.185
Blast him, or we're both gonna die.

360
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.853
Oh, God! Oh, God!

361
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.800
- Aaah! - Whoa! You control control water.

362
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.960
Like, the water inside a guy. That's a gross power.

363
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.530
_

364
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.899
I'm gonna let you live because your fortune sucks.

365
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.739
You can't kill me! I can't be killed!

366
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.490
Trust me, that's not as good as it sounds.

367
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.788
Aaaaaaah!

368
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.457
Ah! Ah! Aah!

369
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.680
Oh, it hurts! It burns!

370
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.680
Fuck! Oh, my God! My ribs!

371
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.172
I can feel my shattered ribs!

372
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.260
Shit, these are useless. Where are the fighting fortunes?

373
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.420
Ah, no-no-no-no-no! Those are blanks!

374
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.720
Without fortunes, the effects are completely unpredictable!

375
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.220
All right.

376
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.827
I am the son of God!

377
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.164
Ah!

378
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.060
Jerry!

379
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.296
- Help me, Jerry! - Mom! Stay away! Just stay away!

380
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.620
Come on and fuck already!

381
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.720
Ma'am, is it possible we're being given a chance

382
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.500
to take a step back and examine our behavior?

383
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.340
You can't kill me, old man.

384
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.840
I also have an unresolved fortune.

385
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.010
"The most successful businesswoman on Earth?"

386
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.024
You could do anything you wanted and you chose... work?

387
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.207
Every day I get closer to an unattainable goal.

388
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.600
A one-woman lifestyle brand, forever!

389
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.280
Well, I just used a dark web account

390
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.340
to hack Goldman Sachs, remove trillions of dollars,

391
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.260
and purchase everything your company offers.

392
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.279
Congratulations!

393
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.700
You're officially the most successful businesswoman on Earth.

394
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.166
Fortune fulfilled.

395
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.499
And now I'm emptying your bank accounts

396
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.179
and giving the money back to Goldman Sachs,

397
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.380
because I sit dead-center on the alignment chart.

398
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.360
You son of a bitch!

399
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.160
How does it feel to achieve your dreams?

400
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.261
Empty, right?

401
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.830
Like when DiCaprio won the Oscar.

402
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.300
You could see it in his face.

403
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.260
I still have one more dream...

404
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.398
watching you die, Rick Sanchez!

405
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.233
Ha! You knew my name!

406
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.828
She's free! Run!

407
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.960
Run, my beauty!

408
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.840
Well, butterfly on a corncob.

409
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.840
I see that I've romanticized a wild animal

410
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.460
the same way Margaret Howe did

411
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.040
when she jerked off that dolphin

412
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.720
in the 19-and-60s.

413
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.790
Both she and I assaulted a captive creature

414
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.120
and expected it to be reciprocal.

415
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.853
Welp, joopityboot.

416
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.420
Time to die.

417
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.734
Ah!

418
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.640
Follow me, my queen!

419
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.742
That's all the bad guys down. We almost got this, Jer.

420
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.640
Ah!

421
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.874
No!

422
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.440
Oh, sticks-to-walls guy,

423
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.320
I-I-I guess we were both wrong.

424
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.100
Oh, God.

425
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.300
Oh! Ah!

426
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.780
Ah! Oh!

427
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.860
Aaaah! Rick! Please!

428
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.340
Jerry, I've got the creature.

429
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.187
- I knew it. I knew it. - God damn it!

430
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.649
Aaaaaaaah!

431
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.409
_

432
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.611
Oh, God!

433
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.072
Aaaaah!

434
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.156
God damn it.

435
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.520
Ah. Holy shit, that was close.

436
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.660
Close to what?

437
00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.100
Close to everyone but your son getting anything they want forever.

438
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.220
You saved me.

439
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.420
I will never stop holding this over you,

440
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.220
as if that buys me anything.

441
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.720
- We should get you some clothes, son. - Oh, oh!

442
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.220
I can just feel the savings.

443
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.420
Hey, wait, uh...

444
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.020
Got this at the crazy place we just were.

445
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.799
It may look like someone stuck a hand-written fortune

446
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.449
in there last second, but I'm pretty sure

447
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.960
that's just the way it came.

448
00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.531
Besides, these don't mean anything.

449
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.700
- _ - Jerry, while I appreciate the sentiment,

450
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.390
this is a huge waste of the last real fortune.

451
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.240
Oh. I'm sorry. I just...

452
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.760
It's cool, it's cool.

453
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.680
- Thanks, friend. - Friend?!

454
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.899
- Did you just say friend? - What?

455
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.520
- W-W-What did I do? - You fucking idiot!

456
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.049
I'm not your friend! Why did you think I was your friend?

457
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.460
Look at this you piece of shit.

458
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.540
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, so? - I was immortal!

459
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.120
I was immortal for that whole fight.

460
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.120
All I had to do was never make a new friend.

461
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.740
- Jesus fucking Christ, Jerry. - I'm sorry! We're not friends!

462
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.000
Yeah, too late, bonehead.

463
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.060
It doesn't say "new permanent friend."

464
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.920
All friendships end, especially new ones.

465
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.460
Well, maybe that's a fate the two of us still control.

466
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.940
I'm... I'm sorry I did that.

467
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.120
It's fine.

468
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.900
The zoo. Animals. Balloons. Moats. Cages.

469
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.520
A fun time for the whole family.

470
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.499
But you don't care about that. You're a zebra.

471
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.890
You're here for the unparalleled dining experience

472
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.959
of hand-fed zebra food. Delicious.

473
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.810
He... Hey, wait. Don't eat...

474
00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.340
Th... That's for the zebras.

475
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.980
It's making you sick! What are you doing?

476
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.729
Jesus, why have they left all the zebra-feeding

477
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:43.989
to the people who come to the zoo?

478
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.870
Is that the only way the zebras can get food?

479
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.800
They're so hungry. What the fuck is happening?

480
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.270
We're out of zebra food. Okay?

481
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.160
There's no food left. Don't come to the zoo.

482
00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.160
This was supposed to be a commercial for zebras,

483
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.300
targeted to zebras.

484
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.200
The premise itself was questionable, but this...

485
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.400
this is a nightmare!

486
00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.260
Don't go to the zoo. Stay away from the zoo.

487
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.779
Oh, God, what are you doing in the booth?

488
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.340
Get out! Get out, you're mad with...

489
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.200
Ow. Eat it. Eat zebra food.

490
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.110
Okay, um. I guess I can't blame Dad for being confused

491
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.640
about what to do with the zebra food.

492
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.060
Also, I have no idea why they're running this ad, like, on a loop?

493
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.160
There were murders in it,

494
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.709
and it was specifically telling you to do

495
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.049
the thing it didn't want you to do

496
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.780
until the very end, when it reversed.

497
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.890
Why would they sell the zebra food in the gift shop,

498
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.530
unless... I mean, do the zebras shop in here?

499
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.160
Are we the ones in the zoo?

500
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.340
Oh, is that the twist?

501
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.266
Okay, we're... it's a human zoo. Got it.
