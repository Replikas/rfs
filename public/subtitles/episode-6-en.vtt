1
00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:34.136
Principal Vagina here --

2
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.263
Don't let the name fool you. I'm very much in charge --

3
00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:39.123
reminding you that tonight is our annual Flu Season Dance.

4
00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:41.167
I don't know how many times I have to say this,

5
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.127
but if you have the flu, stay home.

6
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:44.128
Hey.

7
00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:46.452
The Flu Season Dance is about awareness, not celebration.

8
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.383
You don't bring dead babies to Passover.

9
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:53.471
Okay. Here we go. H-Hey, Jessica. Uh...

10
00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.514
What's up, Morty?

11
00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:56.807
What are you doing?

12
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:58.517
- Um... - Wait, wait.

13
00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:00.728
Were you about to talk... to her?

14
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:03.231
Well... I mean, I was thinking about it.

15
00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:05.274
Dude, stay in your league.

16
00:01:05.358 --> 00:01:07.610
Look at how hot she is. You don't see me going...

17
00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:09.445
to a bigger school in a wealthier district

18
00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:11.113
and hitting on their prettiest girl.

19
00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:12.531
Gee, thanks, Brad.

20
00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:14.242
I throw balls far.

21
00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:15.826
You want good words?

22
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.536
Date a languager.

23
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.372
Try not to worry about it, Morty.

24
00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:21.207
You're a good kid, and there's not a premium

25
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.090
on that right now, but you'll be getting girls

26
00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.752
sometime after Brad's out of shape.

27
00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.475
You're missing the point, Dad.

28
00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:29.048
I don't want girls. I want Jessica.

29
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:31.926
Ah, well, I remember feeling that way

30
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.095
about a young lady named "your mom,"

31
00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:35.554
and that's not an urban diss.

32
00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:37.139
Your mom was my Jessica.

33
00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:38.641
I remember the first time I saw her.

34
00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.244
I thought -- - "I should get her pregnant,

35
00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:41.686
and then she'll have to marry me."

36
00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.896
I beg your pardon, Rick -- inappropriate.

37
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.564
Sorry, please proceed with your story

38
00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:47.275
about banging my daughter in high school.

39
00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:49.753
I'm not sure you wanna take romantic advice from this guy, Morty.

40
00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:51.696
His marriage is hanging from a thread.

41
00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.073
My marriage is fine, thank you.

42
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:55.759
Jerry, it's your house -- whatever you say it is

43
00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.636
is how it is -- but I think a blind man could see

44
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.287
that Beth is looking for the door.

45
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.580
I barely have a reason to care, and even I noticed.

46
00:02:01.664 --> 00:02:03.874
Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that.

47
00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.710
Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you,

48
00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:07.378
but what people call "love"

49
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.742
is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.

50
00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:12.383
It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades,

51
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.385
leaving you stranded in a failing marriage.

52
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.387
I did it. Your parents are gonna do it.

53
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.763
Break the cycle, Morty.

54
00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:19.640
Rise above. Focus on science.

55
00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:24.603
All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.

56
00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:28.482
Yeah, I'm just going to... check on your mom.

57
00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.945
Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?

58
00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.781
I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty.

59
00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:37.742
- It's gonna be great. - Hey, listen, Rick.

60
00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:39.618
Y-Y-You know how you said that, you know,

61
00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:41.702
love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?

62
00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:42.955
Well, I was thinking, you know,

63
00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.666
w-w-- could you make some sort of chemical thing happen

64
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.209
inside of Jessica's mind, you know,

65
00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:48.878
so where she falls in love with me

66
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:50.379
and all that sort of thing?

67
00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:52.524
You know, like, some sort of love potion or something?

68
00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:54.148
Morty, that's such a poor use of my time.

69
00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:56.469
It's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.

70
00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:58.137
You know what? No, Rick!

71
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.764
I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver.

72
00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:01.825
L-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick!

73
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.244
I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing.

74
00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:06.354
W-W-W-W-W-What about me, Rick?

75
00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.356
W-W-W-W-Why can't you just help me out once --

76
00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.774
once -- for once?

77
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.942
You're growing up fast, Morty.

78
00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:15.029
You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass.

79
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:17.031
Listen, this is called oxytocin.

80
00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:18.491
I extracted it from a vole.

81
00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.201
Do you know what a vole is, Morty?

82
00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:22.012
You know what a vole is? It's a -- it's a rodent

83
00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:23.662
that mates for life, Morty.

84
00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:26.099
This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know,

85
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:27.458
that makes it fall in love.

86
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.794
I just gotta -- combine it with your DNA.

87
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:31.629
Oh, well, okay.

88
00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.631
A hair, Morty. I need one of your hairs.

89
00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:35.383
This isn't "Game of Thrones."

90
00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:36.926
Ow!

91
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.929
All right, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on

92
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:40.971
will fall in love with you, and only you, forever.

93
00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.973
- Are you happy now, Morty? - Heck, yeah!

94
00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.059
Thank you, Grandpa Rick.

95
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.936
Hey, there's no... dangers or anything,

96
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.479
or side effects, right?

97
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.147
W-W-W-What am I, a hack?

98
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.400
Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof.

99
00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.987
Eh, unless she has the flu.

100
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.865
Beth, do y-you still love me?

101
00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.284
Ugh, what kind of question is that?

102
00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:04.203
The "yes or no" kind?

103
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.705
Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?

104
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:07.957
Yes.

105
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.041
Are you gonna build them?

106
00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:10.167
No.

107
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:11.836
Then what good was the "yes"?

108
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.839
Wait, i-is loving me the house or the homeless people?

109
00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:17.716
Loving you is work, Jerry -- hard work,

110
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.718
like building a homeless shelter --

111
00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:21.637
nobody wants to say no to doing it,

112
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.347
but some people put the work in.

113
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:25.516
So, what do you say? Do you see me working here?

114
00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.893
Does this conversation seem tedious to me?

115
00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:29.228
Sort of.

116
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:30.991
Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I?

117
00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.084
So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more.

118
00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:36.026
Crap, they need me at the horse hospital.

119
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.278
Puh! This late?

120
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.572
The racetrack had a starlight derby.

121
00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:41.115
There was a seven-horse collision,

122
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.075
and Davin's there alone.

123
00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.995
Davin. Davin.

124
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:48.205
Davin! Davin.

125
00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.541
Davin! Davin!

126
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.918
Davin! Davin!

127
00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:54.920
âª Flu, yo. You gotta be aware âª

128
00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:56.922
âª Aware of all the flu up in the air âª

129
00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:59.592
âª I'm-a get me a shot, make the flu go away âª

130
00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.886
âª Flu-hating rapper, just rapping away âª

131
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.263
âª Yo, yo, flu-hating rapper âª

132
00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:05.598
âª It's a flu-hating rap âª

133
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:09.977
Hey, there, Jessica. Whoa! Oh, whoopsie!

134
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.521
Oh, my god. Morty.

135
00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:14.773
You look really nice tonight.

136
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:17.776
- Wow, thanks. - I love you, Morty!

137
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.778
I love you so much it burns!

138
00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:22.781
Oh, man! I-I love you too, Jessica!

139
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.993
Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?

140
00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.412
Leave him alone, jerk! I'm in love with him!

141
00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:30.414
He is more man than you will ever be!

142
00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:33.584
âª This is about flu awareness âª

143
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.212
âª Gotta be aware of the flu in the air-ness âª

144
00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:38.547
âª Yo, I'm a flu-hating rapper âª

145
00:05:38.631 --> 00:05:40.549
Oh, man, Morty.

146
00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:42.218
I'm really sorry.

147
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:44.637
Oh, well, n-no problem, Brad.

148
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.889
There's something special about you, Morty --

149
00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.307
so special.

150
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.309
Whoa, take it easy! Get your hands off of him!

151
00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.311
Back off! I'm trying to be with my man!

152
00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.896
That's enough, Bradley!

153
00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.707
We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.

154
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:57.209
Oh, come on, Principal Vagina. I just...

155
00:05:57.233 --> 00:05:59.401
Never leave me, Morty. Never!

156
00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:02.446
Uh, sure. I mean, o-of course not.

157
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.949
W-What do you think that was all about?

158
00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:06.700
Who cares? Just hold me.

159
00:06:06.784 --> 00:06:09.119
Let me go! I love you, Morty!

160
00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.956
Let go of me!

161
00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.708
Morty!

162
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.423
She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.

163
00:06:21.507 --> 00:06:23.427
Yeah, Dad, digging around the insides of horses.

164
00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.219
It's not a very romantic setting.

165
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:27.030
Well, Summer, there's always the possibility

166
00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:28.681
that she made the whole work thing up.

167
00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:30.683
Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides.

168
00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:33.644
Grandpa, so gross! You're talking about my mom.

169
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.312
Well, she's my daughter, Summer.

170
00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:36.814
I outrank you.

171
00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:39.567
Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card.

172
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.360
She's not responding to my texts!

173
00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.821
Careful, Dad. Jealousy turns women off.

174
00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.573
Well, isn't that convenient?

175
00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:47.366
Not for the men they cheat on, no.

176
00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.785
Okay, I'm... going to go out...

177
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.120
for some ice cream.

178
00:06:51.203 --> 00:06:52.705
And maybe stop by the hospital...

179
00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:54.665
to support my wife...

180
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.959
with my confidence.

181
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.169
God, Grandpa, you're such a dick.

182
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.964
I'm sorry, Summer. Your opinion means very little to me.

183
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:04.192
How come you're not at this stupid dance everyone loves?

184
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.135
Screw that. I don't wanna get sick.

185
00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:07.886
- It's flu season. - It is?

186
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.597
- Yeah. - Uh-oh.

187
00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:17.062
Please just let this work out.

188
00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:20.024
Do it, Morty. Do it.

189
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:23.068
Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life!

190
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.947
Um... can we maybe go somewhere more private?

191
00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:29.116
Jessica, get a hold of yourself!

192
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.454
You don't deserve to carry Morty's genes.

193
00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:35.664
âª I love Morty âª

194
00:07:35.748 --> 00:07:38.167
âª and I hope Morty loves me âª

195
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.878
âª I'd like to wrap my arms around him âª

196
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.172
âª and feel him inside me âª

197
00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:44.757
Oh, crap.

198
00:07:47.343 --> 00:07:49.261
Morty!

199
00:07:49.345 --> 00:07:51.764
Morty, come on! We gotta get you out of here.

200
00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:53.825
You won't believe this 'cause it usually never happens,

201
00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:55.225
but I made a mistake.

202
00:07:56.727 --> 00:07:58.437
Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here.

203
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.355
- Come on. - Morty!

204
00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.624
Are you okay?

205
00:08:00.648 --> 00:08:02.441
- I'm fine! - Oh, good.

206
00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:05.110
If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself.

207
00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:07.279
I love you bad, Mo-Mo!

208
00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:13.202
Morty, the principal and I have discussed it,

209
00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:16.789
a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way!

210
00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:22.270
I didn't realize when I gave you that serum

211
00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:24.088
that Jessica had the flu -- you know,

212
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.924
t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me!

213
00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.258
What the hell is going on, Rick?

214
00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:29.802
What does it look like?

215
00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:31.529
T-T-T-The serum is piggybacking on the virus.

216
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:32.971
It's gone airborne, Morty.

217
00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:35.516
Oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick?

218
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.101
It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax.

219
00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.227
I whipped up an antidote.

220
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.479
It's based on praying-mantis DNA.

221
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:42.540
You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles.

222
00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:43.816
I mean, they -- they mate once,

223
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:45.779
and then they, you know, decapitate the partner.

224
00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:47.236
I mean, it's a whole ritual.

225
00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:49.363
It's really gruesome and totally opposite.

226
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.781
There's no love at all.

227
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.242
I-I-I basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus.

228
00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:55.786
It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty.

229
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.496
It'll all be over very shortly.

230
00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:04.104
Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything,

231
00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:06.046
but I'm not interested in having sex with you.

232
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.756
These serums, they don't work on anybody

233
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.174
related to you genetically.

234
00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:12.136
Morty!

235
00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:24.606
Okay, well, sometimes,

236
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.608
science is more art than science, Morty.

237
00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:28.569
A lot of people don't get that.

238
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.703
Come on. Are you kidding me?

239
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.664
- Hello! - Morty!

240
00:09:40.748 --> 00:09:43.751
You're not Morty! Bring us Morty!

241
00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.761
Nobody's killing me...

242
00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:57.014
until after I catch my wife with another man.

243
00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.349
I had sex with Billy.

244
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:01.185
But you were already pregnant!

245
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:02.829
Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen?

246
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:05.647
We interrupt "Pregnant Baby" with breaking news.

247
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.274
Come on.

248
00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:09.735
This just in -- Morty Smith's whereabouts are still unknown.

249
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.779
What the hell?

250
00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:14.615
The only thing that is known is... how cute he is.

251
00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:17.201
I love him so much, I want to make love to him

252
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:18.869
and then eat his head.

253
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.871
I love him more than you do, Harold!

254
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.623
You wish, you stupid bitch!

255
00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.249
- Morty's mine! - Morty's mine!

256
00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:25.709
Meant to be together!

257
00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:28.879
Morty!

258
00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:36.762
Where is Morty?

259
00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:53.529
Oh, my god, Rick. The whole world is infected!

260
00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:55.739
Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread.

261
00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.991
- I've really outdone myself. - Outdone yourself?!

262
00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:59.910
W-W-- a-are -- are you kidding me, Rick?

263
00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.537
This is not okay!

264
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.389
Not only do they all want to have sex with me,

265
00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.373
but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!

266
00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.851
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

267
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.544
Mantises are the opposite of voles?

268
00:11:08.627 --> 00:11:11.255
I mean, obviously, DNA's more complicated than that.

269
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.631
You know what, though, Morty?

270
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.466
This right here's gonna do the trick, baby.

271
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.969
It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee,

272
00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:19.304
cactus, shark, golden retriever,

273
00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:21.181
and just a smidge of dinosaur.

274
00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:22.933
Should add up to normal humanity.

275
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.776
I don't -- that doesn't make any sense, Rick.

276
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:26.812
How does that add up to normal humanity?

277
00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.623
What, Morty, you want me to show you my math?

278
00:11:28.647 --> 00:11:30.232
I'm sorry -- a-are you the scientist

279
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.109
or are you the kid that wanted to get laid?

280
00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:37.155
Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses,

281
00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:39.157
but I'm almost sorry we're finished.

282
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:40.742
Yes, it's satisfying work.

283
00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:42.911
Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh -- it's more than the work.

284
00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:45.414
I love being in that sterilized room,

285
00:11:45.497 --> 00:11:47.666
sealed off from the world.

286
00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.002
It's the only time I can really think... and feel.

287
00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:53.589
Hmm, uh, what are you doing?

288
00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.757
I'm playing African dream pop.

289
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.968
What do you do after a long night?

290
00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:02.014
Oh, ha, um, hey, I b-- I'd better get going.

291
00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:04.766
Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.

292
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.727
- Beth... - What is it, Davin?

293
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.646
Just once, I'd like to know --

294
00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.234
...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.

295
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:15.402
What?!

296
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.822
What does Morty's skin smell like?

297
00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:21.450
How soft...

298
00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.869
How soft are his privates?

299
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.787
Let go of me, Davin!

300
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.795
Take me to Morty.

301
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.924
You're not Morty.

302
00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.468
No, I'm Mr. Crowbar,

303
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.803
and this is my friend,

304
00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:44.097
who is also a crowbar.

305
00:12:44.181 --> 00:12:45.974
That's... stupid.

306
00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:50.020
Yeah?

307
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.855
Well, look where being smart got you.

308
00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:53.857
Jerry! Thank God!

309
00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:55.025
God?

310
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.111
God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth.

311
00:12:58.195 --> 00:13:00.280
I'm the one beating them to death.

312
00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:02.616
- Thank me. - Thank you, Jerry.

313
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.034
Thank you.

314
00:13:08.664 --> 00:13:10.749
Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in,

315
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.352
because, you know, once I pull this lever,

316
00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:13.669
it's all back to normal.

317
00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:15.212
Just do it already.

318
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.047
Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush.

319
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.970
I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done.

320
00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.801
It's fixed. You know, we could --

321
00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.803
we could just enjoy it for a little bit.

322
00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.322
I mean, I-I-I-look at how crazy it is.

323
00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:25.931
I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time

324
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.454
you're gonna see something like this?

325
00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:28.976
I mean, soak it in, you know?

326
00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:30.703
It's -- it's pretty neat. It's pretty interesting.

327
00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.247
That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever.

328
00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.029
W-What do we have here, Morty?

329
00:13:41.113 --> 00:13:42.953
Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh?

330
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.993
I-I-I-I-I bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh?

331
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.929
I-I-I bet you feel like the world's smallest man

332
00:13:47.953 --> 00:13:50.163
that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.

333
00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:52.124
Oh, Rick, something's not right.

334
00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.792
Yeah, you.

335
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.127
You're not right -- ever.

336
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.004
No, no! Look, you idiot!

337
00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:23.071
Bet you're loving this, Morty.

338
00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:25.157
This must be the best day of your life.

339
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.076
You get to be the mayor of I-Told-You Town.

340
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.162
You're welcome.

341
00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:41.965
Hold on.

342
00:15:00.484 --> 00:15:02.778
I wish that shotgun was my penis.

343
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.739
If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway.

344
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.366
I don't get it, and I don't need to.

345
00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:11.369
Mom! Dad!

346
00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:13.163
Summer!

347
00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.291
Where's Morty?

348
00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.667
I don't know.

349
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.896
Do you think Grandpa Rick had something to do with this?

350
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.671
It's not fair to assume that, Summer.

351
00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.715
Oh, not fair? Give me a break.

352
00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:25.801
He is a selfish, irresponsible ass,

353
00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:27.260
and he left my mother.

354
00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.138
A real man stands by his woman.

355
00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:37.854
âª Tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo âª

356
00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:40.524
Boy, I really Cronenberged the world up, didn't I?

357
00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.359
We got a whole planet of Cronenbergs

358
00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.027
walking around down there, Morty.

359
00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.172
A-At least they're not in love with you anymore, though.

360
00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:47.948
That's a huge step in the right direction.

361
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.242
Oh, my God! It's a living nightmare!

362
00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.786
How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?

363
00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.288
Me irresponsible?! You -- all I wanted you to do

364
00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.040
was hand me a screwdriver, Morty!

365
00:15:57.124 --> 00:15:59.793
You're the one who wanted to be -- wanted me to buckle down

366
00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.129
and make you up a... roofie-juice serum

367
00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:05.340
so you could roofie that poor girl at your school.

368
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.385
I mean, g-- w-w-w-w-w-- w-- are you kidding me, Morty?

369
00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.446
You're gonna try to take the high road on this one?

370
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.930
Y-Y-Y-Y-You're a little creep, Morty.

371
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.306
Y-You're a -- you're -- you're --

372
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.308
you're just a little creepy... creep person.

373
00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.078
All right, fine. I should have just listened to you

374
00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.645
when you refused to make the serum.

375
00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.623
I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick.

376
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.333
But I'll tell you something -- you know what?

377
00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:23.942
You gotta accept your part of the blame!

378
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.735
I'm not the one who fouled up the serum!

379
00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.571
I'm not the one who -- who -- who --

380
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.030
who haphazardly, you know,

381
00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:30.699
mixed a bunch of nonsense together

382
00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.492
and created a bunch of Cronenbergs!

383
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:34.870
- You gotta fix this, Rick! - All right, all right, Morty.

384
00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.639
You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here,

385
00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.374
but I do have one emergency solution that I can use

386
00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:41.293
that'll kind of put everything back to normal,

387
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.752
relatively speaking.

388
00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.254
Here, Morty, put this on while I do

389
00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.256
a little bit of scouting.

390
00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.604
Wow, Rick, I gotta say --

391
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.767
you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time.

392
00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:04.733
I mean, I-I really thought that the whole place

393
00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.610
was gonna be messed up for good,

394
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.570
but here, you did it -- y-y-you -- you --

395
00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.322
you figured out that crazy solution,

396
00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:11.489
like you always do.

397
00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:13.325
Whoo! That's some great luck.

398
00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.327
Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it.

399
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.371
I'm great. That's the real reason.

400
00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.498
Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy?

401
00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:22.334
Will you hand me a screwdriver

402
00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.169
so I can finish my ionic dis-- defibulizer?

403
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.504
Sure thing, Rick. Here's a screwdriver.

404
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.798
All right, Morty. Thank you very much.

405
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.801
We got one screw turn... and two screw turns...

406
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.595
and...

407
00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.143
All right, Morty, here we are.

408
00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.145
Oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?!

409
00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:44.105
W-W-W-We're dead! What is going on, Rick?

410
00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:45.690
I'm freaking out!

411
00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.418
Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

412
00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.069
No, I can't deal with this!

413
00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.695
Calm yourself, Morty.

414
00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.280
I can't deal with this, Rick!

415
00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:53.841
- Calm down, Morty. - This can't be real!

416
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:56.052
- You gotta calm down, Morty. - W-W-W-W-We're ripped apart!

417
00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.953
Shut up and listen to me!

418
00:17:58.036 --> 00:17:59.287
It's fine. Everything is fine.

419
00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.848
There's an infinite number of realities, Morty,

420
00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.540
and in a few dozen of those,

421
00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.584
I got lucky and turned everything back to normal.

422
00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:06.336
I just had to find one of those realities

423
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.047
in which we also happen to both die around this time.

424
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.590
Now we can just slip into the place

425
00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:12.175
of our dead selves in this reality

426
00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:13.843
and everything will be fine.

427
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.345
We're not skipping a beat, Morty.

428
00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.489
Now, help me with these bodies.

429
00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.597
This is insane.

430
00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:19.841
Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay?

431
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:21.327
I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me --

432
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.311
I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.

433
00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.355
Rick, what about the reality we left behind?

434
00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.108
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty?

435
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.609
The answer is don't think about it.

436
00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:31.820
It's not like we can do this every week, anyways.

437
00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:33.503
We get three or four more of these, tops.

438
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.282
Now, pick up your dead self and come on.

439
00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:36.616
Haste makes waste.

440
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.827
I-I-I don't suppose you've considered this detail,

441
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.413
but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did,

442
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:45.333
we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.

443
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:55.260
âª Look on down from the bridge âª

444
00:18:55.343 --> 00:19:02.434
âª There's still fountains down there âª

445
00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:11.192
âª Look on down from the bridge âª

446
00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:18.533
âª It's still raining up here âª

447
00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:29.044
âª Everybody seems so far away from me âª

448
00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:36.718
âª Everybody just wants to be free âª

449
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:42.891
âª Look away from the sky âª

450
00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:49.689
âª It's no different when you're leaving home âª

451
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:58.573
âª I can't be the same thing to you now âª

452
00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:02.577
âª I'm just gone âª

453
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:08.291
âª Just gone âª

454
00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:15.382
âª How could I say goodbye? âª

455
00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:20.512
âª How could I say goodbye? âª

456
00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:24.265
You know, the thing about a shark...

457
00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.726
he's got lifeless eyes...

458
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.728
black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

459
00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:30.313
When he comes at ya,

460
00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.315
he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya,

461
00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.276
and then the -- the blood, and the red, and the water...

462
00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.571
You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?

463
00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:41.408
Sometimes. But, I'm ashamed to admit,

464
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:47.038
now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.

465
00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.249
Here we are, Cronenberg Morty --

466
00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:50.875
a reality where everyone in the world

467
00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.335
got genetically Cronenberged.

468
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:54.504
We'll fit right in, Cronenberg Morty.

469
00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.965
It'll be like we never even left Cronenberg world.

470
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:58.425
Yeah, Cronenberg Rick,

471
00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.348
but, you know, I'm gonna miss Cronenberg world,

472
00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.029
because everyone was Cronenberged all along

473
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:03.721
like us from the beginning, you know?

474
00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.408
I mean, I-I wish we hadn't genetically ruined

475
00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.350
Cronenberg World beyond repair like we did,

476
00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.978
you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people

477
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.521
just walking around.

478
00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.204
Don't you worry about that sort of thing,

479
00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.357
Cronenberg Morty.

480
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.735
Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?

481
00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:22.866
Did you get any of that?

482
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.909
It's a good-a show!
