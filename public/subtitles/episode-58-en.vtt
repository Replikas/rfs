00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.633
Previously, on "Rick and Morty"...

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.552
Jerry, I had sex with your wife.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.360
- Ohhh! - I did it! I fixed portal travel!

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.590
Jack the Ripper, at your service.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.304
- Cool! - This happened too?

6
00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:19.186
- I'm pregnant. - Honey, she's just like you!

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.105
- It's raining meatballs! - Okay, something is...

8
00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:23.480
Jerry Smith died doing what he loved...

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.560
- getting stung by bees. - Off.

10
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.260
Off what? Have some respect.

11
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.530
It's Dad's funeral.

12
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.440
I'm gonna name you Jerry Jr.

13
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.140
Thanks for solving that murder, guys.

14
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.959
- Here's a skateboard. - Aw, thanks, Tony Hawk!

15
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.199
- Morty, say you'll marry me! - What?

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.240
- What? - Just say yes!

17
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.800
- Yes? - Okay...

18
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.140
Rick, do you promise to...

19
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.119
I do, and for our honeymoon let's go to a sealed chamber

20
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.002
- lined with ionized deuterium! - Why?

21
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.020
Because the charge acts as a narrative decelerant.

22
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.280
Morty, none of this is real.

23
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.560
We're in a "previously on" spiral. Clear your head.

24
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.384
- After all that's happened?! - No.

25
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.400
I-I'm innocent!

26
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.800
I didn't release those bees!

27
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.887
I love Jerry!

28
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.580
- What'd I just say? - When?

29
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.699
Okay, great execution.

30
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.267
Let's go back to the chamber.

31
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.100
Now repeat after me, Morty... "Next time on 'Rick and Morty.'"

32
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.800
Next time on "Rick and Morty"?

33
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.860
No. Previously, on "Rick and Morty"...

34
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.260
Ignore it, Morty. "Next time on 'Rick and Morty.'"

35
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.440
It counteracts his toxins.

36
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.780
Next time on "Rick and Morty."

37
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.947
- Whose toxins? - Hey, stop it!

38
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.490
Previous Leon! Grab him!

39
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.999
Hold on tight, Morty! We got to get through the opening titles!

40
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.662
Opening titles of what?

41
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.819
- Whoa! We're in space! - Let go of me! Ow! Ow!

42
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.169
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

43
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.520
What planet is this?

44
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.710
Cover your eyes on this part.

45
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.885
Oh, my God, it's a giant squirrel!

46
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.387
Why are we dressed like old-timey people?

47
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.681
- What the hell's going on? - No way!

48
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.351
Why is my dad in a suit?

49
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.500
- Best episode! - Why am I butter?

50
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.870
Okay, we're almost through.

51
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.440
- Ohh! - Ohh!

52
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.110
Ow!

53
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.420
Ugh, and we're back!

54
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.530
Stop!

55
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.000
- What just happened? - Let go of me!

56
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.060
Why was there music?

57
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.280
Because of this conceptual little piece of shit!

58
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.480
- Grab his feet! - If we have opening titles,

59
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.110
d-does that mean that we're a...

60
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.260
Let your body purge the meta-venom, Morty.

61
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.169
Don't succumb to his pointless self-aware bullshit.

62
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.500
It's not pointless, it's cool!

63
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.280
- He's got a gun! - Eat lead, pussy!

64
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.510
No, no, no!

65
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.636
Fuck!

66
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.060
Oh!

67
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.180
Son of a...

68
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.610
- Did he use a portal? - He wishes.

69
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.040
He wriggled back to the meta layer

70
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.239
through a hole in the fourth wall.

71
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.820
Put these on and help me find it.

72
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.309
- _ - I-I don't like this, Rick.

73
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.440
Yeah, you shouldn't. It's not a likable premise.

74
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.869
I mean it's funny when I do a little nod to the viewers, but...

75
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.909
- What viewers?! - That's the right attitude, Morty.

76
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.270
A few carefree verbal asides, always by me.

77
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.480
None of this season-three "Moonlighting" shit.

78
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.509
- Okay, here it is. - You're going to... to patch it?

79
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.640
No, he subverted actual reality, Morty.

80
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.860
He needs to be put down like a rabid dog.

81
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.700
Ow! Fuck!

82
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.760
Oh, yeah, no, you don't wanna wear those over here.

83
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.359
_

84
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.850
Maybe he went down that road?

85
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.739
No, no, no. If he took that, he'd end up a hero.

86
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.520
Damn it, Rick. I don't like this.

87
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.750
I-Is this whole place just...

88
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.220
A bunch of groan-inducing wordplay

89
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.340
for seven TV critics that won't even enjoy it?

90
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.619
It's worse than you think, Morty.

91
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.443
We're basting in meta radiation right now.

92
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.360
Our credibility is being permanently eroded.

93
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.540
Every second we spend here

94
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.680
is the equivalent to 10 "Space Jam" cameos.

95
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.850
You should have thought of that... previously!

96
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.870
Get him!

97
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.660
Ow! Ow!

98
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.470
Oh, no! Bless me, Heavenly Father, for you will save me.

99
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.550
Now I feel bad. Let's just get out of here.

100
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.580
Because he prays?

101
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.300
You know Hitler was Catholic, right?

102
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:36.133
I'm here, Leon.

103
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.240
- Uhh... - Okay.

104
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.460
He apparently prays very well.

105
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.380
Time for you two to meet the Lord.

106
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.409
That's okay, we're good. Treat it like a bear attack.

107
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.830
Just walk backwards and make yourself look big.

108
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.780
I love a good refusal of the call.

109
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.560
Hello, Rick.

110
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.600
Hello... Amish Juggler?

111
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.460
His name is Story Lord.

112
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.195
Story... Lord?

113
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.900
Listen, trust me, take Amish Juggler.

114
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.520
- You can have it. - Story Lord.

115
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.980
Rick, h-he's the villain from that toy train I bought you.

116
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.060
Very good, Morty. The fictional versions of you

117
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.980
trapped me in a Bible show for children,

118
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.440
but I used make-believe Christ

119
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.420
to transcend fiction and enter meta-reality.

120
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.980
Now I'm the one doing the trapping.

121
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.520
Leon was the bait.

122
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.890
- Bait?! - Jesus?

123
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.716
Aaah!

124
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.990
Aah!

125
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.950
Don't ever...! Dumb mother...!

126
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.720
You're using Jesus to beat us up?

127
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.200
- Have you seen "South Park"? - Good call-out, Morty.

128
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.770
That's the kind of meta I like,

129
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.980
the kind that keeps us creatively accountable.

130
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.300
Oh, God. Not the Bane. Not the Bane!

131
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.530
He Baned me, Morty. Oh, Jesus Baned me.

132
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.479
Y-You can't beat me up. I-I'm... I'm...

133
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.992
I'm technically a Christian child!

134
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.130
And I'm your worst nightmare.

135
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.400
I'm the Jesus from every Jesus joke.

136
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.000
- The one without a God. - Morty! Take this and get out!

137
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.540
Thank you.

138
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.090
Looks like Story Lord's story is about to become...

139
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.756
based on real events.

140
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.809
What do you want with that?

141
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.759
I want what any character wants.

142
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.052
Motivation!

143
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.555
- What? That's dumb. - So lazy!

144
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.500
Forward your notes to my ass!

145
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.110
Wait, what? He just left.

146
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.640
Kind of makes you want to be our unlikely ally, huh?

147
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.700
Oh, I guess not.

148
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.390
Previously, on Jesus Christ...

149
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.520
- Hey, I'm Jesus. - I'm Mary.

150
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.531
- That's my mom's name! - Stop.

151
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.280
- Dude, she's a hooker. - She's a better disciple than you!

152
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.660
Ow! Aw! Owww!

153
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.640
Oh, no.

154
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.250
I can't die.

155
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.670
I 'ave a proposition for you.

156
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.170
I work alone.

157
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.480
If I suck-a your blood, I'll be invincible! I think!

158
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.300
- You'll never know. - Aah!

159
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.100
Billionaire immortal entrepreneur Jesus Christ

160
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.490
has placed all his money

161
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.390
into what he's calling a "second chance at love."

162
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.939
- Hang on, Mary! - The data!

163
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.940
So beautiful!

164
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.651
Make me normal, witch.

165
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.071
Take it all!

166
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.020
Eat your pudding, Mr. Christ.

167
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.950
What are you smiling at?

168
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.744
Your name.

169
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.440
What's happening, Rick?

170
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.039
Leon's venom makes you think more and more of your life is behind you

171
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.140
as he feeds on your released potential.

172
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.297
Leon, y-you saved our lives!

173
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.400
- Oh, not yet, he hasn't. - Jeez, Rick!

174
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.580
- So mean! - He's meta, Morty.

175
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.718
His life doesn't matter.

176
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.095
Yours does. That's why we need to get back.

177
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.969
- _ - Well, this doesn't feel like a citadel.

178
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.433
_

179
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.144
Uh, maybe it's cooler on the inside.

180
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.160
This isn't what it looks like.

181
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.260
This is a very special diet for successful writers.

182
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.680
Why do you look like my character?

183
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.120
I am your character!

184
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.447
And you are going to improve me.

185
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.199
But you're Story Lord. You're great.

186
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.970
Great isn't good enough!

187
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.660
I've killed Rick and made myself real!

188
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.360
I'm better than some shitty toy train.

189
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.280
Is this your office or your apartment?

190
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.200
Why does it smell like you sleep here?

191
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.400
You're my creator. Why are you pathetic?

192
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.710
- Because you failed! - And whose fault is that?

193
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:03.840
What the hell happened?

194
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.900
You want to know what happened? Like, specifically?

195
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.720
Well, the Ricks wanted to do a "Canterbury Tales"-type thing,

196
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.959
but none of them have actually read fucking "Canterbury Tales."

197
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.039
So then they told me to make it like the poker-game episode

198
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.120
of the Batman cartoon

199
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.100
where the bad guys tell stories about Batman.

200
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.230
Then they kept telling me it "needed something."

201
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.080
Yeah, no shit, it needed something!

202
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.000
It needed to never be pitched!

203
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.270
I did my job!

204
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.870
Goomby, the Ice Queen, the Tickets Please guy.

205
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.000
They just bailed on it!

206
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.660
The website didn't even fucking work!

207
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.440
And it was a shitty URL to begin with,

208
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.620
"Story-dash-train"? Who uses a dash?

209
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.820
They set me up to fail. They fucked me!

210
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.750
They fucked me and you're lucky I haven't blown my brains out!

211
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.540
Right. Just give me a motivation, you hacky fart.

212
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.960
Okay, here's your motivation.

213
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.780
You're looking for motivation.

214
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.930
You want all the motivation.

215
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.177
- That's lazy. - It got you this far.

216
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.380
Must be nice, by the way.

217
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.850
Wish I could afford to dress like a bisexual acting coach

218
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.040
from the '70s.

219
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.140
My motivation... is motivation.

220
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.645
Okay. Bye.

221
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.190
Oh, no, my bitter friend. You're coming with me.

222
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.100
Yo! If you don't see me coming, it's a bad fortress!

223
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.930
- Where are we? - Headquarters of the Self-Referential Six.

224
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.109
They're meta nerds that found out they could be less bearable

225
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.650
- as a team. - They can help us?

226
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.599
No, but there's a prisoner here that can. Shh.

227
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.899
- Don't tell them that. - Rick Sanchez.

228
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.460
I've been waiting for this moment for years.

229
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.547
Oh, good. Morty, this is Miss... Lead.

230
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.870
I should kill you where you stand.

231
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.889
_

232
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.280
I brought you Previous Leon.

233
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.239
You'll want to lock him up in your detention center.

234
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.020
It's a trick! He wants your prisoner!

235
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.520
- You dick. - Liar!

236
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.740
Talk about a mislead.

237
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.060
- Anti-meta field. - Fancy device.

238
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.500
I think I can recall the time you built it.

239
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.106
Don't try it, Flash Back!

240
00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:44.110
_

241
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.550
You know, I-I'm excited about the upcoming election.

242
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.220
This forcefield will be impenetrable by meta-energy.

243
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.840
It runs on hydrogen isotopes.

244
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.575
Hmmm.

245
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.980
It runs on hydrogen isotopes.

246
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.670
A few barrels of petroleum should dampen it.

247
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.080
Run, Morty!

248
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.780
Were those not there before?

249
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.419
Guess there's been a... Connie TinuityError.

250
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.430
_

251
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.132
- These people are the worst! - I told you! Way overpowered!

252
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.250
- Look out, Rick! - Forget him. He's a nameless guard.

253
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.730
That's Protago Nick.

254
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.309
His beam has the power to make any character the protagonist.

255
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.434
_

256
00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.062
D-Duck!

257
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.520
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

258
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.340
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

259
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.400
Gah! What are you doing, Marvin?!

260
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.830
Not dying, that's what I'm doing.

261
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.500
Oh, what's going on? What happened?

262
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.170
I did it again, Katie. I ran out on another job.

263
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.200
Well, if you didn't do that, you wouldn't be my man.

264
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.650
_

265
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.964
_

266
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.990
I was almost tempted to just let it go.

267
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.900
- That's how much I hate it here. - Smash cut!

268
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.370
Remember me, Rick?

269
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.880
- Who's this guy, now? - I am Mr. Twist.

270
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:04.896
_

271
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.300
The fifth member of the Self-Referential Six.

272
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.870
- Who's the sixth? - That's the twist, Morty. It's you.

273
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.949
- What? - Ignore him, Morty.

274
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.479
The twist is there's no sixth member

275
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.240
- and he tells that to everybody. - In any case, you're ours now.

276
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.180
You can't free yourself without a twist,

277
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.700
- and I control them. - You don't control every twist, Mr. Twist.

278
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.520
- I've got a twist for you. - Impossible! What is it?

279
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.542
- Aah! - Aha!

280
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.520
Nice try! Like I didn't see that coming.

281
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.380
Fuck me.

282
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.718
- Great work, Morty! - I'm adapting!

283
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.094
Here's our ticket out of here.

284
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.499
They got him in a cell made out of sports

285
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.980
because it's the opposite of story.

286
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.530
Do I want to ask who he is?

287
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.960
His name is Brett Caan.

288
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.680
He has the power to make things always have been other things.

289
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.200
I think that's called retconning.

290
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.480
B-But his name's Brett Caan?

291
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.300
I mean, Rhett's a name too. His name could be Rhett Caan.

292
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.340
It is. And always has been... now.

293
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.740
- Whoa. - Careful, Morty.

294
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.170
Stay clear of his retcon range.

295
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.480
Until he agrees to help us.

296
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.868
Rick, you've always trusted me.

297
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.900
Nice try. Here's how it's gonna work.

298
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.260
You're gonna make it so Morty and I never came here.

299
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.759
Once that's always been the case,

300
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.920
- I'll free you remotely with this. - What is my purpose?

301
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.740
To wait until I tell you to pull that lever.

302
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.172
You are fucking kidding me.

303
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.980
If you don't free me right now, Rick,

304
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.630
I can make very, very bad things always have been the case for you.

305
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.800
Is that a threat, you fuck?

306
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.880
- Y-Y-You can rot in there. - Rick.

307
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.149
You know what, Rhett? Forget what I said.

308
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.600
We've always been friends.

309
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.010
Good one.

310
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.340
Whoa, easy, Rhett.

311
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.810
Don't forget that coffee mug I gave you.

312
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.950
You always were able to be killed with coffee.

313
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.403
Aaah!

314
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.150
New plan. Run. Again.

315
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.490
The twist being...

316
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.520
You were born without bones.

317
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.760
See ya never!

318
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.670
There's never been anything outside this fortress.

319
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:48.700
God damn it!

320
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.620
And this fortress has always been an orange!

321
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.440
Pluh! Great plan, Rick!

322
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.869
Yeah, I'm not pushing back on that, Morty,

323
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.790
I have royally fucked us.

324
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.020
Ugh! It hurts.

325
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.870
We've been past the fourth wall too long.

326
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.860
- We won't be real much longer. - You killed us, Rick.

327
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.100
You just had to hate meta storytelling.

328
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.320
In my defense, Morty,

329
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.620
I think you can agree my hate was justified. Ohh!

330
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.110
Least... earned... death... ever...

331
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.740
Death is a threshold.

332
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.000
Ugh! What... What happened?

333
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.047
You atoned.

334
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.507
Who... Who are you?

335
00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:39.960
I'm Joseph Campbell. Soup?

336
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.300
I almost considered not making it because my name is Campbell,

337
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.340
but then I thought, stay in the moment, Joe.

338
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.500
- Follow your bliss. - How are you here?

339
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.394
R-Rhett Caan said there was nothing.

340
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.660
Some things never change about mythology.

341
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.800
There's always an old man with soup.

342
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.480
Name one story that doesn't have one.

343
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.209
- Uh, Jack and the Beanstalk. - "Basketball Diaries."

344
00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.900
- Every "Matrix." - Every movie ever.

345
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.989
All right, I don't have to defend myself to you people.

346
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.400
Where's my soup?

347
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.618
Previous Fuckin' Leon.

348
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.800
Why is that prick here?

349
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.280
No more a prick than you, friend.

350
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.620
Meta characters erode reality.

351
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.760
But all characters are meta, Rick.

352
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.880
All of us are nourished and consumed by chaos,

353
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.240
like newborns at the breast of a meth addict

354
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.670
- in a lifeboat filled with forks. - I know what you have to do, Rick.

355
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.360
Scrub Campbell's browser history?

356
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.370
Just trust Previous Leon.

357
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.475
Could you previously us a way home?

358
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.780
Uh, well, I'll sure enjoy trying.

359
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.840
Yeah, I bet you would.

360
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.710
Rick can't change, Morty.

361
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.440
Change is what you might call his Kryptonite.

362
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.180
Except instead of being super,

363
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.780
he's, you know, kind of a pussy.

364
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.940
Let's do it.

365
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.360
Previously, on Rick...

366
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.819
Get him off! Get him off!

367
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.202
Oh, boy.

368
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:52.250
- He almost killed you! - Okay, well, I feel bad,

369
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.070
I kind of pressured you into trying that.

370
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.544
- You called me a pussy. - I said I feel bad!

371
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.120
This is a map to a region rich in narrative ore.

372
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.620
I wish you the best of luck.

373
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.840
Faster, Morty! I'd help,

374
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.762
but I can't blister my inventing hands.

375
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.180
- How long will it take? - Years.

376
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.690
You can live in my wood shed.

377
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.223
- Just don't open the door after dark. - Why not?

378
00:14:11.224 --> 00:14:13.339
Get out here, you Communist Jews!

379
00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.970
- Dude. Maybe I'm not an alcoholic. - I know, right?

380
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.350
You fucking "Back to the Future" rip-offs!

381
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.920
- It's ready. - Rick, I should stay.

382
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.439
- Why? - I'm pregnant.

383
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.619
- What are you doing? - It wasn't him, Rick!

384
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.160
- Then who?! - Me! I never left.

385
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.868
But you had to think all this happened to make that.

386
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.453
And I can get this through the titles?

387
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.955
If you hang on tight.

388
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.832
What about my beard and unborn child?

389
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.083
Let them go.

390
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.100
- Thank you, Leon. - When you get home, Rick,

391
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.880
do some classic adventures.

392
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.019
- Like season one... - I'm so sick of that fucking note.

393
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.700
What the fuck does it even mean?

394
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.720
Ohh!

395
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.510
Now, one last time.

396
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.860
- What's my motivation? - Motivation.

397
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.689
This machine will siphon it from everyone in the universe.

398
00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.520
Perfect. Greenlit. Launch it.

399
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.200
Oh, I think it's working! Yes, I can feel it!

400
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.940
Something I did is actually affecting someone!

401
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.080
I don't want to work anymore.

402
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.950
I do, but only as an excuse to not practice guitar.

403
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.190
Why don't we just write any number down on the score sheet?

404
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.620
Oh, why even do that?

405
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.460
- _ - Wait, you have to register?

406
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:37.300
Yes! I can feel it! I'm so motivated!

407
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.030
I want... a lot!

408
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.819
- Story time's over. - Ha! Hardly your decision.

409
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.198
Did you seriously double down on motivation as your motivation?

410
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.380
- It's a good idea! - There's no such thing!

411
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.759
There's joyful and there's joyless,

412
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.020
and we've had our fill of one.

413
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.900
Morty, make that sweaty writer stop working

414
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.248
while I kill off his character.

415
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.211
I have never been more driven to destroy someone.

416
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.769
Yeah, well, I'm driven to lower my blood sugar,

417
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.298
but guess who's getting tacos after he kicks your ass?

418
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.100
So you're jacked. Who cares?

419
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.330
- Cum gutters. - I don't like that phrase.

420
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.555
I don't take notes.

421
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.160
You can't beat me, Rick.

422
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.910
I have one million times your motivation!

423
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.442
So do those guys with the cellphone kiosks at the mall.

424
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.550
The hair is wrong.

425
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.471
Like you'd be picky about licensing.

426
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.807
Actually, I would. I happen to believe that...

427
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.566
- You can do that? - You got to want it.

428
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:07.780
Come on, just stop. I-I don't want to fight you.

429
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.380
Kid, I'm a writer that wrote something successful.

430
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.509
So if you want me to give it up,

431
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.549
you're gonna need a black belt

432
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.840
- or a big pair of tits. - Yeah, well, I don't have those.

433
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.270
In the mythical sense, I have both.

434
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.320
Joseph Campbell?

435
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.206
Yeah, nice try. He died in the '80s.

436
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.420
Only you can see and hear me, Morty.

437
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.836
- Just repeat what I tell you. - Okay.

438
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.750
Sir, you're only proud of your creation's success

439
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.500
because you want to be creative,

440
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.580
but creation doesn't happen through gimmicks,

441
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.053
technology, and distribution.

442
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.920
It doesn't even happen through work.

443
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.460
Creativity is frankly adjacent to mental illness

444
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.143
and overlaps with it substantially.

445
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.000
A lot of talented people kill themselves

446
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.438
and all of them are miserable.

447
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.020
The real gift is to be ungifted,

448
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.520
and from what I saw in your Green Arrow spec script,

449
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.040
that's the gift you were given.

450
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.660
You couldn't have seen that.

451
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.600
I'm Joseph Campbell. I saw it.

452
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.260
- The villain was a placeholder. - I said I saw it, Jan.

453
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.300
I didn't say I could get past page five.

454
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.829
Y-Your villains aren't the problem.

455
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.560
The problem is, when you write,

456
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.600
you're a villain.

457
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.160
If you want to be a hero, just stop.

458
00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.135
You know what? Maybe I will register.

459
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.473
Say it! Tell me I'm the new Mr. Nimbus!

460
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.780
Oh, looks like your writer took a hiatus.

461
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.811
Oh, fuck.

462
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.355
You're less motivated to fight now,

463
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.024
so this is literally punching down, but you've got it coming.

464
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.440
Please, let me live.

465
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.000
I promise to be cooler.

466
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.201
I'll be less inside baseball. Maybe I change my name? Ow!

467
00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.454
You failed me.

468
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.374
No, I failed you.

469
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.462
All good things must come to an end.

470
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.340
All bad things too, though, so don't flatter yourself.

471
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.400
Jan, Joseph Campbell says you have to be the one to put him down.

472
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.600
Wait, wait, wait, Joseph Campbell also says

473
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.520
you have to use this brand-new limited edition Rick plush,

474
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.460
available only on rick-plush.biz.

475
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.600
- Supplies are limited. Act now. - He did?

476
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.680
Shhh.

477
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.620
Jesus, that's the last time I buy a toy from a Rick.

478
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.079
Ooh, the plushies are obviously well made.

479
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.220
Thanks for getting us back alive, Rick.

480
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.520
Well, I am a master of both worlds, Morty.

481
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.060
Joseph Campbell told me to stop writing.

482
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.309
Because it should be effortless.

483
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.409
And when it happens organically, that's when it's meant to be.

484
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.420
You know, like, um, like me.

485
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.740
I'm a writer, here's a pencil. Writers use pencils.

486
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.319
Okay, so, like, what if, like, a pencil used me?

487
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.280
Like, um... okay! Yeah!

488
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.240
Okay, so it's like a magic pencil

489
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.920
that writes the writer's life...

490
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.460
holy shit, it's a movie about a writer!

491
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.740
I am back!

492
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.120
Yeah, I'm Tag-Man! I-I-I-I live in the tag!

493
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.020
I-I-I am the tag! I'm Tag-Man!

494
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.698
Tag... Tag of the episode... man! "Did you get any of that?"

495
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.709
When the... yeah, when an episode's over,

496
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.349
look out, because, yaaaah, here comes Tag-Man!

497
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.700
And I'm... I'm crazy! Tag-Man! Yeah!

498
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.770
I'm... I'mma tag your ass!

499
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.460
Tag that ass. Tag-Ass-Man!

500
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.300
I'm an Ass-Man now!

501
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.770
I'm a... I'm a Tag-Man!

502
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.520
Here's what you get. Here's your tag!

503
00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.900
Yeah, you want some more?

504
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.340
You want... you want some more tag, you sick piece of shit?!

505
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.260
I'm... because I'm Tag-Man!

506
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.640
I miss my wife.

507
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.526
Too bad. This is it!

508
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.728
Tag-Man, yeah!

509
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.731
Did you get any of that?
