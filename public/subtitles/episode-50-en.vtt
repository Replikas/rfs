00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.630
Goodbye, Mr. Cookie President.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.340
Ugh!

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.052
Oh, thank you, Morty.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.240
You know, this cookie really crumbled after Rick left.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.515
Uh, sorry about that. I-I-I think he was just hungry.

6
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.540
Look, I gotta run.

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.759
I-I'm sure you guys'll figure it out.

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.060
I-I believe in you!

9
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.840
Morty! Can you help us with this UFO-shaped hole?

10
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.449
Sure, geez, but, y'know, only because I was in the neighborhood.

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.840
Morty, thank God!

12
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.411
The beast emerged right after your grandpa left

13
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.260
and its gem went missing...

14
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.320
Geez, that is a crazy coincidence

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.260
that I-I if I were you, probably just best left alone.

16
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.380
He's right. We-We should celebrate.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.500
- Feast? - No time.

18
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.755
S-S-Sounds pretty classic though,

19
00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:46.299
don't let me hold you up!

20
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.638
Son of a bitch. He marked it.

21
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.614
_

22
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.198
- Ah! - _

23
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.580
Phew.

24
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.480
Hah.

25
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.160
What the...

26
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.839
- Hey, what the hell? - Agh! Jesus!

27
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.579
You got some of that green stuff on you too, huh?

28
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.380
Th-Th-This is bad. Th-This is really bad.

29
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.469
Hey, how do you think I feel?

30
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.520
I had the ultimate stash hole and now I got a kid in my thigh.

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.340
Look, you seem like a perfectly nice guy in my hand hole,

32
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.600
but if I can't sort this out, I'm dead...

33
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.340
What the hell, dude? Gross.

34
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.539
- I-I-I was just trying to... - You're just trying to what?

35
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.000
Where'd this stuff come from?

36
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.250
Garbage Goober, get out here and eat this garbage.

37
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.630
Mmm, trash, I love trash, yum yum trash,

38
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.719
- I wanna eat trash... - Hell yeah, I love that lil guy.

39
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.180
Wait a minute.

40
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.850
Is that Mountain Dew in my quantum transport solution?

41
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.159
I-I saw you were marking the levels

42
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.380
- so I-I had to top it off. - "Top it off?"

43
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.460
Do you know how dangerously toxic this stuff is?

44
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.280
And you added it to my portal fluid?!

45
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.860
Only because you don't trust me!

46
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.190
Oh, that's great logic, Morty...

47
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.460
forgive me for not doing the kissy chef gesture

48
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.199
since you probably spilled this [BLEEP] everywhere

49
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.399
and I don't want to teleport my lips.

50
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.800
I did I did not spill it!

51
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.779
I won't take your word for that and I shouldn't have to,

52
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.400
which is why I have sidekick rules.

53
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.800
If you can't follow them...

54
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.120
I can be replaced, yeah, yeah, so you keep telling me.

55
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.680
Excuse me? Did you just try to call my bluff?

56
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.960
Have you ever seen me bluff?

57
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.360
Fine. You know what, replace me!

58
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.940
Replace me, Rick! Just do it.

59
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.199
Good luck finding someone that can be told 80 thousand times

60
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.228
how replaceable they are!

61
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.500
Okay. I'll see your bluff call and raise you reality.

62
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.840
I can't pretend I haven't been looking forward to this.

63
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.444
Behold my Wheel of Better Things Than Morty.

64
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.920
Wh-What are you eight? I-Is this macaroni art?

65
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.219
You expect me to believe you built this

66
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.323
because you don't care?

67
00:03:16.324 --> 00:03:18.560
No, I built this because I don't expect shit from you.

68
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.600
Come on, anything!

69
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.420
Anything but Morty, let's go! Come on baby, no whammies!

70
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.790
Duh-duh-duh-duh stop! Okay, that's it.

71
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.839
- Two crows. You're fired! - You know what? Eat [BLEEP].

72
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.099
You're just trying to make me feel worthless.

73
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.219
I never said you're worthless.

74
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.299
In fact, I've given you a very clear metric of your worth:

75
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.590
Two crows.

76
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.300
Note I didn't say three!

77
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.290
Man, that is not a healthy relationship.

78
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.120
I hope you don't mind me eavesdropping.

79
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.260
Maybe we can figure out some sort of sound-proof bandage solution.

80
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.602
Hey, did Garbage Goober eat my porno magazines?

81
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.340
So, were you like, a friend of Rick's?

82
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.420
- Were you? - Good question.

83
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.380
W-What's he doing, i-is he out there making sure

84
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.530
you see him collecting two crows?

85
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.890
And now you're thinking, gee,

86
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.100
maybe if he cares enough to hurt me this bad...

87
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.480
dot dot dot.

88
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.480
Break the cycle, Morty.

89
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.620
Change the things that you can change.

90
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.120
That's what I did. And now I'm free.

91
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.760
Only cramming six years into six minutes, fellas.

92
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.980
Take your time!

93
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.730
Now that's what I'm talking about!

94
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.800
If ya nail this next one, I've got bird quaaludes.

95
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.000
And I might even share.

96
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.100
Y-You know you can stop doing that for my benefit.

97
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.320
Y'know, or-or keep doing it. Doesn't matter. I'm out.

98
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.683
- I'm walking away. - Wait. Morty. Don't go.

99
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.268
Not until you see this!

100
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.660
Commence bird on a wire!

101
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.050
Yeeeeaaaahhhhh!

102
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.360
Jerk.

103
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.230
Hey, let's hang out.

104
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.260
We're like brothers now,

105
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.190
we both got away, y'know, w-where are you at?

106
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.020
Ooh, you know what, shoot, can't.

107
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.871
I'm an alien, um, so...

108
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.799
That's okay, Rick turned my bike into a spaceship

109
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.940
for "solo adventures" like picking up his Venusian foot ointment.

110
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.850
God, I'm seeing it so clearly now.

111
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.330
Oh. Wait. I-It says here you're on Earth.

112
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah. Ah. Don't come here.

113
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.600
Why not? Look, I-I get it, my room is sometimes messy too,

114
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.170
I'll-I'll pick you up right outside your...

115
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.561
- ... mental asylum. - Busted.

116
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.396
You literally said "I'm free."

117
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.620
I'm literally not free.

118
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.700
Stop! That's my blanket!

119
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.777
How do you know Rick?

120
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.580
Look, I came to your place with him one night

121
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.740
after the bar closed.

122
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.620
I started messing around in your garage

123
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.880
and I spilled that portal stuff on me

124
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.500
and he... kind of launched me to Australia...

125
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.980
like with this weirdly primitive catapult, but...

126
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.160
But the ammunition is an airtight carbon chamber,

127
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.320
yeah, that-that... that's how we lost our cable guy.

128
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.420
Anyways, that kind of experience shakes you up.

129
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.132
So, sorry I misled you, have a nice life.

130
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.302
Nick. You got a visitor.

131
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.750
Damn, what happened to you?

132
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.340
The guards like to beat us on Sundays.

133
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.760
- Still better than Mondays. - Geez, what happens then?

134
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.560
They lick our faces when we're tied down.

135
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.220
- Plus it's meat loaf day. - Well...

136
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.270
- you're leaving now, buddy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

137
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.909
I-I swiped 'em off the guard on my way in.

138
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.310
I-I mean, sure, yeah, I could undo my lock, but then what?

139
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.360
After the smartest guy in the world's done with ya,

140
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.919
it's kinda hard to find a footing again.

141
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.279
That's why I need to get you out of here.

142
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.920
We're not the problem, he is.

143
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.780
And if you can have a fresh start, then maybe I can too.

144
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.959
It's not like it's a prison break.

145
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.259
We're just leaving, like, a hospital

146
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.940
that wants to help you extra bad.

147
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.060
Follow me!

148
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.931
Hey, get back here, you better open this door!

149
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.920
- I can fly! - Keep running, Nick.

150
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.130
The more you sweat, the saltier your cheeks.

151
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.050
- Lick this! - Thanks, Morty.

152
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.566
That dude's got a tongue like a cat.

153
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.100
Stop those Portal Boys!

154
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.770
Did you hear that? That's gonna stick!

155
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.270
Damn. Just like Jackie Chan!

156
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.650
Hah! I guess that makes me Chris Tucker.

157
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.760
I-I guess?

158
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.208
Gonna get you!

159
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.280
Holy [BLEEP]! Did you see that?

160
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.719
I mean, you blinded a guy with puke!

161
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.850
Oh, it was insane.

162
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.940
- Gimme dap. - Am I doing it right?

163
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.160
D-D-Did I give you a dap yet?

164
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.400
Look at us. We got out.

165
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.680
And not just from the asylum but from Rick.

166
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.060
You get to say what an adventure is now.

167
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.129
- You still got that list? - Dude, we can't do that stuff

168
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.149
without Rick's tech.

169
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.820
Then it's time the Portal Boys get themselves a portal gun.

170
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.559
Remember your training, crows.

171
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.080
The idol should be around that corner!

172
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.179
Do you guys just follow training when you feel like it?

173
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.320
That's not being trained, that's being dicks.

174
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.338
Ah, now I see.

175
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.860
The real treasure is empathy.

176
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.860
And that's worth way more than any knick-knack.

177
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.553
You guys just earned yourselves another adventure!

178
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.240
The adventure is, you're fired.

179
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
Sorry, guys, if I wanted another bleeding heart,

180
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.440
I'd inject reanimator serum into an actual bleeding heart.

181
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.140
Relax, this is an avian planet

182
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.760
with 40 million species of bird,

183
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.200
even one day of working under me

184
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.200
will make you apex geniuses down there.

185
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.739
Now hop into these pneumatic canisters

186
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.840
they used to use at bank drive-thrus in the '70s.

187
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.440
What the... Hey! Who's tractor beaming me?!

188
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.440
- Nobody tractor beams me... - _

189
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.280
Nobody descrambles my tractor beam scrambler to boot.

190
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.600
Sorry for the tractor beaming,

191
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.760
but did you lose these two crows?

192
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.920
Oh, uh, yeah, no, I-I dropped 'em off

193
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.720
'cause I-I can't hold a candle to them.

194
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.040
Y'know, it s-seemed like a... the decent thing to do.

195
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.500
Be your crows. Train yourself.

196
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.100
Crows are then trained.

197
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.419
I'm open to what you're describing

198
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.440
if it's easier than wiping an unearned smirk off my grandson's face.

199
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.720
- W-What do I do? - Look at your crows.

200
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.280
Be your crows.

201
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.680
God I am so glad I'm a primate.

202
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.825
Fine. Looking at my crows.

203
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.660
We train ourselves to stop training.

204
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.165
The trained are untrained, we are untrained.

205
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.510
All training is complete.

206
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.628
Because no training was needed.

207
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.900
My God. I-I get it, now.

208
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.800
We are gonna shove this crow shit down Morty's throat!

209
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.340
Nick, m-maybe this isn't a good idea.

210
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.540
L-Like what if he catches us?

211
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.010
He could trap me in a Matrix again.

212
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.130
Listen to yourself.

213
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.940
We wouldn't even be in this situation

214
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.940
if the dude hadn't [BLEEP] us both over.

215
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.530
Damn it. He must be showing the gun off

216
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.500
to his stupid crows... i-it's not fair!

217
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.320
It's okay, we can still liberate all this other stuff.

218
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.440
Let's only grab what we need, though.

219
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.336
Oh, no. [BLEEP]. That's Rick's can crusher!

220
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.889
H-He spent three weeks perfecting that.

221
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.800
Morty, buddy, you forget that we're in this together.

222
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.620
Besides, tell me that didn't feel the slightest bit good.

223
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.120
I mean, yeah, but w-we can't do that again.

224
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.510
Why the hell not?

225
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.240
Whoa!

226
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.800
Haha!

227
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.200
- Haha! - Here we go, bitch!

228
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.566
Son, have you fallen in with a weird stranger

229
00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:09.528
and are now trashing your grandpa's place?

230
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.660
'Cause I'll help!

231
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.560
Dad? Psh, whatever, man.

232
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.940
- Ah. Yeah! - Yeah! Now eat my ass, Rick!

233
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.360
Suck it, Sanchez!

234
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.940
Morty, is that what I think it is?

235
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.300
I mean, it's the equivalent of an iPhone 3 and it's empty,

236
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.200
but it means the Portal Boys be portal-ing!

237
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.299
Rick incoming.

238
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.780
Oh, crap, we better skedaddle!

239
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.080
Moooooorty.

240
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.370
But what about my dad, he-he's like a-a... puddle.

241
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.479
You heard the garage, Rick'll turn him back into a solid

242
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.720
- when he gets here! - Sorry, Dad, gotta go be heroes.

243
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.510
G-Gonna take your car, love you!

244
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.190
That's us down there with the poop brown roof.

245
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.840
- What is that? - Oh. Ha. That?

246
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.430
T-That's... nothing.

247
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.414
But I see "Two Crows" written right here beside...

248
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.920
Gene with donkey brains, half a Paul Giamatti,

249
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.340
and... sentient shit.

250
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.100
I guess the "joke" being that crows are stupid?

251
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.000
I think it's a little more nuanced than that.

252
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.360
Right, because you just learned empathy from us 10 minutes ago,

253
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.800
but now we're going to learn we don't get your humor?

254
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.880
[BLEEP] horse shit.

255
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.225
Yeah, there's not a ton to "get," genius,

256
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.460
the "joke" is your grandson was so replaceable

257
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.980
that "even" two crows could do it.

258
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.149
Haha. It's funny except it's not.

259
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.760
Right, well, to be honest, that is how I felt at the time.

260
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.480
But I've-I've rounded a corner. I seriously have, you guys.

261
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.640
Well, now it's time to round the corner of death!

262
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.940
Let the crow-volution begin.

263
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.780
Aah!

264
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.240
Aw, that sound. What have you done?

265
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.790
Turned crows against dozens of humans in a 300 meter radius.

266
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.270
Heeeelllllp... pleaseee...

267
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.270
Oh, now you beg for help?

268
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.261
- That wasn't me. - What do you mean?

269
00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.880
Dooooown here.

270
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.479
Jerry, what the [BLEEP]? Why are you a puddle?

271
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.250
You don't deserve these!

272
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.820
- Haha. - Genius.

273
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.500
- Caaatch you at a baaad time? - Yeah, Jerry.

274
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.440
They took my goddamn crows!

275
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.440
Not now, Garbage Goober! Get back in your hole!

276
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.070
Hohoho, our first adventure!

277
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.580
This definitely the place?

278
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.599
Yeah, Rick's been ripping these guys off for years,

279
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.800
they'll-they'll be really...

280
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.360
... uh, grateful.

281
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.440
- Y'know, there... - Let's just get that fluid, bud.

282
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.878
The Portal Boys are about to be in portal business!

283
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.349
Here he is.

284
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.384
This rat was skimming your crystal harvest

285
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.160
and sending it to a spaceman named Rick Sanchez.

286
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.900
- Bastard! - Screw Rick! Kick his dick!

287
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.400
Yeah, right?! But me and Nick here, we-we put a stop to that.

288
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.740
The people of Kuntak thank you.

289
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.220
He's a bad guy, right?

290
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.760
Y-You're gonna bring him to justice?

291
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.620
Yeah, of course.

292
00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.700
Uh, okay, p-pleasure doing business!

293
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.040
Not so fast, Morty.

294
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.440
We're not leaving until we get what we came for.

295
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.300
- Funny, I'm prepared to. - So, hey, look,

296
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.980
wh-what we want is portal fluid.

297
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.500
As our thanks.

298
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.020
Portal fluid?

299
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.400
You think I'd live in a lizard mine if I had portal fluid?

300
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.980
Right, okay, or we could just kill you for it.

301
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.020
He's kidding.

302
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.390
He's... t-the Portal Boys only kill with kindness.

303
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.420
And with guns.

304
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.349
Oh, no. Oh, no. I-I'm not the one shooting!

305
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.266
- Kill them! - I'm sorry.

306
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.050
Stop! Stop! They're unarmed!

307
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.441
Ahh! What the [BLEEP]?! Morty! Morty!

308
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.350
Cool place ya got here. Very Dark Crystal meets Hot Topic.

309
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.910
Now where are my damn crows?

310
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.750
Seriously?

311
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.126
Is there anything not on theme here?

312
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.370
Even now your primate storms our ship to assert his dominance.

313
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.070
Touch the sacred egg and ascend.

314
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.353
No longer shall you take orders from this beast.

315
00:14:12.354 --> 00:14:14.147
But taking orders from you i-is fine?

316
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.650
Silence, Ape!

317
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.680
C'mon, if you think my crows are gonna leave the great thing we have

318
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.650
for whatever high fantasy bull[BLEEP] this is?

319
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.560
You 're wrong. R-Right, guys?

320
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.570
Th-This is seriously a toss-up.

321
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.220
Uh... someone wanna get that?

322
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.410
Oh. It's me, isn't it? Woof.

323
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.960
Lemme just make sure it's not an emergency... Yello.

324
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.338
Rick, I'm so sorry, I-I messed up big!

325
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.450
Morty? It's okay, y-ya can't be worse off than me.

326
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.200
I-I got portal splashed, robbed you,

327
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.680
jumped into a rebound with a psycho,

328
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.030
and-and left a trail of dead!

329
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.360
Wow, somebody's been busy.

330
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.839
I-I did it 'cause you hurt my feelings

331
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.160
w-when you chose the two crows!

332
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.220
Jesus, it was a bit, I'm getting my ass kicked

333
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.860
by this dumb [BLEEP] crow story, it's all gone tits up.

334
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.960
Ha, okay, I-I miss you, man.

335
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.317
Uh, goddamn it, might've been a bit too frank there.

336
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.400
Yeah... gonna have to call ya back.

337
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.454
Ahh!

338
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.790
Gah! Tiny-handed little brat...

339
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.320
You think you can [BLEEP] with me and get away with it?!

340
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.740
Then you don't know Nick.

341
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.820
Busted. You don't get it, do you?

342
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.610
As long as we have these portals,

343
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.960
- you can never escape me. - What the hell, man.

344
00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.228
I-I thought we were both victims of Rick's abuse.

345
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.640
Maybe we are, maybe we're not.

346
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.480
Maybe we both just drink at the same bar

347
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.080
and maybe one night I tried to take his portal gun.

348
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.660
See I thought Rick was my ticket to something special,

349
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.480
but it turns out you were, Morty.

350
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.408
And look at me now... I'm a Portal Boy.

351
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.911
That name sucks! I was just trying to yes-and!

352
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.246
You don't get it, Morty.

353
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.900
We're partners.

354
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.417
Now fall in line or I'll make your life a living hell.

355
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.085
No... thank... you.

356
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.310
Pity, I can't have you connected to me if you're not on my side.

357
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.425
That means I gotta kill you.

358
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.860
The thing is, I already got a partner,

359
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.429
and there's no room for promotions.

360
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.580
What the [BLEEP] did you just do?

361
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.470
Cut you out of my life.

362
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.400
Ahhh!

363
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.330
See how quickly your allies abandon you, Rick Sanchez?

364
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.890
Lucky for me, abandonment's my bread and butter.

365
00:16:42.754 --> 00:16:44.464
Oh, [BLEEP]. You were supposed to die!

366
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.840
I gotta hand it to you... I was iffy about this one,

367
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.717
but crow tech slaps!

368
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.641
Finish him, you fools!

369
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.220
Go ahead. Do it.

370
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.271
You guys look so rad. I deserve to go out this way!

371
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.946
Bird... qua... luudes.

372
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.029
Done.

373
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.661
Oh, my God, that was awesome.

374
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.640
Y-You could've killed me back there.

375
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.220
H-How did you guys ever forgive me?

376
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.300
Right, 'cause this toxic thing I have with Morty

377
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.419
doesn't define us.

378
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.620
Man, crows are empathetic as [BLEEP]!

379
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.592
Definitely saving this one!

380
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.346
Rick and two crows!

381
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.019
Oh, my God, Morty.

382
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.605
Here, here, come here, l-let-let grandpa fix you up,

383
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.640
What do you want, a robot hand? A lizard hand?

384
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.319
I can make it big again like that one time?

385
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.443
Just my regular hand!

386
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.780
Right, not a time for bits, I get it.

387
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.130
There ya go, good as new.

388
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.540
So we're like, back-back, right?

389
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.060
Rick and Morty, together again.

390
00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.740
- Fu-Full reset? - No.

391
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.220
No, Morty, I think we're done.

392
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.239
Be-Because I spilled the portal fluid and didn't tell you?

393
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.780
No, Morty. 'Cause you were too afraid to tell me.

394
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.640
What we had was abusive. Don't you see?

395
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.216
I'm a bad partner because I never made you a true partner.

396
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.860
The crows made me see that.

397
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.279
I thought they were a joke like you,

398
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.449
but it turns out they're more enlightened than any of us.

399
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.724
O-Okay? And-And what's the undercut?

400
00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.310
You're not hearing me. I will never be the same,

401
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.720
so I need to leave with the crows

402
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.159
and see what more they can teach me.

403
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.850
Oh. Oh.

404
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.819
Here, I want you to have this.

405
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.990
Oh, wow I...

406
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.170
You know what, Rick? You really have changed.

407
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.460
Thanks, Morty.

408
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.000
I'll always be your grandpa, Morty.

409
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.040
Just kinda obsessed with crows now.

410
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.160
âª Every day the sun burns brighter âª

411
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.370
âª With you by my side âª

412
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.480
âª And that we go on forever âª

413
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.340
âª Together you and I âª

414
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.940
Aww, shit! Rick and two crows!

415
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.420
Kicking off my new franchise!

416
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.080
The galaxy is our telephone wire!

417
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.280
We'll do a thousand seasons,

418
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.620
14 episodes each, 9-9 seconds a pop

419
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.119
because that's the future of viewing...

420
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.000
shows on your shoes... Sneaki!

421
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.459
That's when you've got everybody's attention...

422
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.879
when they're putting crap on their feet.

423
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.540
That's when they wanna laugh. Cry.

424
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.920
Or feel anything besides a shoe going on their foot!

425
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.500
Watch sitcoms on your sneakers!

426
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.967
The Rick and Two Crows Show,

427
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.320
we're gonna be layin'... layin' walnuts on the road

428
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.020
for car tires to open em' you know what I mean?

429
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.640
Forever, it's Rick and two crows, forever!

430
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.513
Where do you think you're going?

431
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.120
Oh, well, ya know...

432
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.934
the-the red light usually means there's... garbage...

433
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.187
Did you seriously not talk to Rick yet?

434
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.420
I kinda hinted at it.

435
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.740
L-Look, I know it's not the job I came here for,

436
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.984
- but it's an honest living. - Goddamn it, Harold.

437
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.420
What do they call you... Garbage Goober?

438
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.280
You are a doctor for God sakes!

439
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.180
Look, I don't know how I let this happen,

440
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.160
but I-I've let it play out so long that I can't stop now.

441
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.038
You're a coward.

442
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.650
You're right. This ends here and now.

443
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.420
Garbage Goober, we got freshy trash trash for ya!

444
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.320
Extra stinky just the way you like it!

445
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.840
Mmm, trash, I love trash...

446
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.885
yum yum trash, I wanna eat trash.

447
00:21:00.345 --> 00:21:02.012
Did you get any of that?
