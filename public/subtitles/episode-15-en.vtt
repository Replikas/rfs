00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:06.872
Steve, I just got a weird e-mail. Did you buy us airline tickets?

2
00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.808
Aw, shoot. It was supposed to be a surprise.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.878
I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.713
so I'm treating the family to a vacation!

5
00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:15.014
Steve, you're so sweet.

6
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:16.949
- Thanks, uncle Steve! - Best uncle ever!

7
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.217
Look out, world.

8
00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:19.919
The Smith family is going to Paris!

9
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:21.387
Yeah! Awesome!

10
00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:24.589
Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash!

11
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.060
Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry,

12
00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:30.129
but life is made of little concessions.

13
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:31.264
I-- You know what?

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.965
You're gonna land on your feet, Jer.

15
00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.901
Some company out there's gonna thank their lucky stars

16
00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:36.569
they hired my little brother.

17
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.105
- Who the [bleep] are you? - My goofy brother, Steve.

18
00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:41.574
He's been living here almost a year now.

19
00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:42.809
Are you losing your mind?

20
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:46.145
Hey, someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks.

21
00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:47.713
Am I right?

22
00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:50.750
- Oh, my god! - Call an ambulance!

23
00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:53.085
- Oh, god! Steve! - What the hell, Rick?!

24
00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:54.587
Will everybody just relax for a second?

25
00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.088
There's no such thing as an "uncle Steve".

26
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.591
That is an alien parasite.

27
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.261
- But I've known him my whole life. - No, you haven't, Jerry.

28
00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:05.398
These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories,

29
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.935
and then they use those to multiply and spread out, take over planets.

30
00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:10.303
It's-- It's disgusting.

31
00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.698
- Steve wasn't real? - He's a real piece of shit.

32
00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:13.520
This is a big one.

33
00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.179
Somebody probably tracked it in last week

34
00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:17.176
on the bottom of their shoe on a piece of alien fruit.

35
00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:19.045
- Someone? - Get off the high road, Summer.

36
00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:22.014
We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.

37
00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:24.116
But uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike!

38
00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:25.785
No, "Steve" put that memory in your brain

39
00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:28.421
so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply.

40
00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.256
We could be infested with these things.

41
00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:32.124
So we got to keep an eye out

42
00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:34.260
for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.

43
00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:35.361
Ooh, whee!

44
00:01:35.363 --> 00:01:37.096
Whatever you want, Rick! We're here to help!

45
00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:41.367
Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.

46
00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.271
âª

47
00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.401
âª

48
00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:18.070
All right. There's six of us, and that's it.

49
00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:21.007
Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.

50
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.342
Maybe you got the first one in time, Rick!

51
00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:25.811
Can't afford to chance it.

52
00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.252
Dad, why does our house have blast shields?

53
00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:34.854
Trust me, Beth, you don't want to know

54
00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:36.188
how many answers that question has.

55
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.090
Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic!

56
00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:41.561
Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together.

57
00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:45.731
Y-- remember that? After "The Hulk" musical?

58
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.871
Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder,

59
00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:53.606
and foam fists don't make you strong.

60
00:02:53.608 --> 00:02:55.675
I know. Friends make you strong.

61
00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:57.843
I watched the same musical you did.

62
00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.779
Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?

63
00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:02.748
Why did all the drinks have to be extra large?

64
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.283
Oh, the hulk. I just got that.

65
00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:07.053
Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck.

66
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:08.921
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me.

67
00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:11.624
At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose.

68
00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.392
Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine.

69
00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:16.796
I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be.

70
00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:20.132
Somebody call for repairs?

71
00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:21.601
Yay! Cousin Nicky!

72
00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:22.902
It's me, cousin Nicky.

73
00:03:22.904 --> 00:03:24.870
I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not.

74
00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:29.542
I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here!

75
00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.311
It's true.

76
00:03:32.313 --> 00:03:34.780
We really do get into some crazy situations as a family,

77
00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:37.049
mostly when we're cooped up like this.

78
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.118
Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right.

79
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.419
Let's get some fresh air.

80
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:41.954
Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick.

81
00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:43.422
We have to stay quarantined

82
00:03:43.424 --> 00:03:45.458
until we know that there's no more of these things.

83
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.559
I hear you, Morty.

84
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.294
Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin'--

85
00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:50.496
"We're walkin' here!"

86
00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:51.831
Nicky, get--

87
00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:53.065
Oh!

88
00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:54.834
What the...?

89
00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:56.602
Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!

90
00:03:56.604 --> 00:03:58.571
Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us!

91
00:03:58.573 --> 00:04:00.940
If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.

92
00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:02.341
But how did you know it was Nicky?

93
00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:04.143
I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.

94
00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:06.078
So we can't trust any of our memories now?

95
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.481
Nicky was the reason we found that old Nazi submarine.

96
00:04:08.483 --> 00:04:09.682
Did that not even happen?

97
00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:11.617
Well, of course it happened.

98
00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.987
Now that I possess the mighty staff of rah-gubaba,

99
00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.024
the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich!

100
00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:21.627
This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.

101
00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.330
Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal.

102
00:04:24.332 --> 00:04:26.298
I'm comfortable being called a Nazi.

103
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.335
You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings?

104
00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:31.971
Yeah. Think before you talk shit.

105
00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:35.007
Rah-gubaba, help me kill America!

106
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.143
Mr. Beauregard!

107
00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:41.814
After due consideration, I have elected not to retire.

108
00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:43.449
Yeah! Oh, thank god!

109
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.952
Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend.

110
00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:49.455
Set a course for Morty's high school.

111
00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:52.124
Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened,

112
00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.293
then I wouldn't still be the family butler.

113
00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:55.861
Dare to dream.

114
00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:57.463
Wait.

115
00:04:57.465 --> 00:04:59.365
And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler,

116
00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:03.002
it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble.

117
00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:05.004
No! Don't flashback!

118
00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:06.706
You're just gonna make more swelling.

119
00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.074
- Just relax. - Don't worry, Jerry.

120
00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:09.108
We called the fire department.

121
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.077
You know they won't come here anymore.

122
00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:15.014
Marmalade is served!

123
00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:16.682
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

124
00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:18.150
Oh, whee!

125
00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:20.986
I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine.

126
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.523
Take that, Summer!

127
00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:25.991
We're trying to sleep.

128
00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:27.860
I don't want to go to the dance alone.

129
00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:31.264
Then perhaps you shouldn't.

130
00:05:31.366 --> 00:05:33.466
Aww. Mr. Beauregard.

131
00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:36.936
- Shall we, master Morty? - We shall.

132
00:05:36.938 --> 00:05:39.004
Oh, wait, don't leave without letting

133
00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.706
photography Raptor take a picture.

134
00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:46.345
Everybody stop remembering!

135
00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:48.047
These parasites are like bed bugs,

136
00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:50.216
and every flashback is another mattress. Look!

137
00:05:50.218 --> 00:05:52.785
There's only supposed to be six people in this house.

138
00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:54.253
But there's always been 10.

139
00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:55.421
No!

140
00:05:55.423 --> 00:05:56.889
Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down

141
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.057
means that there's four parasites.

142
00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:59.358
You sure about that, Rick?

143
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.026
Begging your pardon, master Rick,

144
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.062
but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion

145
00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:04.263
surrounding that number.

146
00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:05.531
All right, there's six of us.

147
00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:06.932
And that's it.

148
00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.435
Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole,

149
00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:11.937
Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, photography Raptor,

150
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.372
Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.

151
00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:15.241
Uh, dad, that's like 10 people.

152
00:06:15.243 --> 00:06:17.209
6, 10, what's the difference?

153
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.745
I just love the number 6 for no reason!

154
00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:21.046
Where's my pencil at?

155
00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:24.216
- Here, Rick! Use me! - Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!

156
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:26.318
Yeah, I guess that is what happened,

157
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.254
but I don't get why I would do that.

158
00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:30.055
Everybody makes mistakes, Rick.

159
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.991
Why do you think I have one of these?

160
00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:35.628
That's it. Photos.

161
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.896
Hard evidence.

162
00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:39.665
You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole.

163
00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.667
Well, what do you know about this?

164
00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.170
You're not in any of mine.

165
00:06:44.172 --> 00:06:48.107
All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school.

166
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:50.943
What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family?

167
00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:52.611
It's not like we're mormon or dying.

168
00:06:52.613 --> 00:06:55.781
I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend

169
00:06:55.783 --> 00:06:58.818
is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen.

170
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.452
Summer!

171
00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:01.954
Tinkles!

172
00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:04.123
It's past my bedtime.

173
00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:06.192
Not in never past bedtime land!

174
00:07:06.194 --> 00:07:08.127
Here we go!

175
00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.197
âª Summer and Tinkles friends with each other âª

176
00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.300
âª Living in never past bedtime land âª

177
00:07:14.302 --> 00:07:17.803
âª No kitchen sinkles no little brother âª

178
00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:20.806
âª Going to raves and waving our hands âª

179
00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:22.641
âª Summer and tinkle, friends to the end âª

180
00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.476
âª Group text the whole crew, my mother... friends! âª

181
00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:26.378
âª Ketchup to the salt, salt to the fry âª

182
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.880
âª "T" to the "inkle" with a capital "I" âª

183
00:07:27.882 --> 00:07:31.084
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

184
00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:33.886
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! - Summer, we're trying to sleep.

185
00:07:33.888 --> 00:07:35.654
It was Tinkles!

186
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:36.689
Tinkles?

187
00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:38.324
That is su-- Suspicious.

188
00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:40.292
We're always hearing about this Tinkles character,

189
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.994
- but we never get to-- - Hi, everybody.

190
00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:44.163
I'm Tinkles, and these are my friends.

191
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:46.999
See, everyone? Tinkles is real.

192
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:48.334
That means so am I.

193
00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:50.502
- Sorry, Summer. - Man, I'm sorry, Summer.

194
00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:53.239
I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.

195
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.008
Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic

196
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.143
to know who's family and who isn't.

197
00:07:58.145 --> 00:07:59.678
I know who the Smiths are.

198
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.914
I've known Beth since high school.

199
00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:06.018
And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend.

200
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.253
Thanks, Jerry.

201
00:08:07.255 --> 00:08:10.522
Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off.

202
00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:12.858
Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long.

203
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.727
I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl.

204
00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:15.928
Aah!

205
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.997
- Grandpa Rick! - Hold still, "Summer".

206
00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:20.232
Rick, that is my daughter.

207
00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:22.701
Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary?

208
00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:25.204
I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.

209
00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:27.506
Rick, these are our family and friends,

210
00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:29.375
the people we barbecue with.

211
00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:31.377
Have you forgotten the barbecue?

212
00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:32.678
Wait, why would you want me to--

213
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.113
You're one of them, aren't you?

214
00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:37.116
Rick. You love those barbecues, Rick.

215
00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:38.684
You love them. Hai!

216
00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:39.718
Remember it, Rick?

217
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.288
Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg!

218
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.056
What is this? '90s Conan?

219
00:08:44.058 --> 00:08:46.025
Remember the barbecue.

220
00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:47.359
Remember the barbecue.

221
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:48.894
Remember the barbecue.

222
00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.263
You know what, Pencilvester?

223
00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:53.399
It took me my whole life to realize it,

224
00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:54.867
but I love barbecuing.

225
00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:56.702
- You're good at it, Rick. - Watch me, baby.

226
00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:58.737
I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, "Cuisine"

227
00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:01.540
or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks.

228
00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:02.775
Yeah, check me out.

229
00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:04.743
I'm like Tom Cruise from "Cuisine".

230
00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:05.744
Yeah.

231
00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:07.446
Is that what it's called? "Cuisine"?

232
00:09:07.448 --> 00:09:08.814
Wow! Hey, everybody.

233
00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.283
Let's give it up for the grillmaster Rick!

234
00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:12.484
Rick! Rick! Rick!

235
00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:17.957
Wait.

236
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.094
Noooooo!

237
00:09:22.096 --> 00:09:23.295
Shoot. Now look.

238
00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:25.731
It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page. Can you find me?

239
00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:27.266
Check out all these zany characters.

240
00:09:27.268 --> 00:09:29.568
We'll be right back after these messages.

241
00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.572
I think you should put down the gun

242
00:09:32.574 --> 00:09:33.907
and we should get you to a doctor.

243
00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:35.775
What do you say we take down these blast shields?

244
00:09:35.777 --> 00:09:37.544
- Yeah. - I can't do that, Sleepy Gary.

245
00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:38.845
All right, everybody listen to me.

246
00:09:38.847 --> 00:09:40.547
I don't know if any of you guys are real,

247
00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:42.549
but this house has been infested with fake loved ones

248
00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:43.950
that spread through fake memories,

249
00:09:43.952 --> 00:09:45.952
and our planet will be destroyed if they get out.

250
00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:51.458
But, Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff.

251
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.261
You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart.

252
00:09:54.263 --> 00:09:56.963
They're selling Nintendo 3DS systems for $149.99 on sale,

253
00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:59.566
plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card.

254
00:09:59.568 --> 00:10:01.734
Brings the total price down to $110 after tax.

255
00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:04.104
Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches

256
00:10:04.106 --> 00:10:05.472
for 230 bucks apiece easy!

257
00:10:05.474 --> 00:10:07.474
They're all limited-edition "Zelda" ones.

258
00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:08.942
Hurry! Hurry! Come with me!

259
00:10:08.944 --> 00:10:11.244
We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one

260
00:10:11.246 --> 00:10:12.812
and we can play Nintendo games!

261
00:10:12.814 --> 00:10:14.981
Nintendo, give me free stuff.

262
00:10:14.983 --> 00:10:17.484
Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that,

263
00:10:17.486 --> 00:10:19.319
but also, I would never do that.

264
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:20.787
Don't overreact, Rick.

265
00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:23.056
- Sleepy Gary, a word? - Sure, Jerry.

266
00:10:23.058 --> 00:10:24.657
Rick, keep a level head, okay?

267
00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:27.427
'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein--

268
00:10:27.429 --> 00:10:31.431
He's actually Frankenstein's monster.

269
00:10:33.234 --> 00:10:36.803
Sleepy Gary, my head is filled with memories of our friendship.

270
00:10:36.805 --> 00:10:40.507
I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend,

271
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:42.842
but if those memories can't be trusted, then...

272
00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:43.943
Jerry, just say it.

273
00:10:43.945 --> 00:10:47.347
Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real?

274
00:10:47.349 --> 00:10:48.848
Jesus, Jerry.

275
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.085
No, you're real. Hey, look at me.

276
00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:53.753
Now, I don't know which way is up out there,

277
00:10:53.755 --> 00:10:56.523
but I know us, and you're real, Jerry.

278
00:10:56.525 --> 00:10:58.491
Remember our vacation?

279
00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:03.295
They're filming that new "Star Wars" movie down the coast.

280
00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:06.766
- Should we check it out? - Sure. Why not?

281
00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.409
Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.

282
00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:19.579
I'd like that.

283
00:11:25.486 --> 00:11:28.090
What are we doing?

284
00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:35.728
I don't give a damn what else happens out there.

285
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.631
You and I are going to survive this.

286
00:11:38.633 --> 00:11:39.999
Okay.

287
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:43.236
Hey, we agreed. Never in the house.

288
00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.573
That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out?

289
00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:49.175
Uh, no thank--

290
00:11:49.177 --> 00:11:50.376
Okay.

291
00:11:50.378 --> 00:11:52.879
Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh?

292
00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:54.614
Anybody here think it's suspicious

293
00:11:54.616 --> 00:11:57.083
that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?

294
00:11:57.085 --> 00:12:00.753
Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam.

295
00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:02.088
So, what are you gonna do

296
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.723
when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?

297
00:12:03.725 --> 00:12:06.292
Shi-i-i-i-t. I'mma bust a--

298
00:12:06.294 --> 00:12:08.728
No! Get out of my head, parasite!

299
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.929
- No! - Drop it.

300
00:12:09.931 --> 00:12:11.597
Give me the gun, Frankenstein!

301
00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:15.701
Give it back!

302
00:12:15.703 --> 00:12:17.637
Yeah!

303
00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:19.272
Frankenstein!

304
00:12:19.274 --> 00:12:21.140
Is anyone here even real?

305
00:12:21.142 --> 00:12:22.542
Am I the only real person on Earth?!

306
00:12:22.544 --> 00:12:23.810
Maybe.

307
00:12:23.812 --> 00:12:25.945
Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real.

308
00:12:25.947 --> 00:12:27.880
You know me. I'm Reverse Giraffe.

309
00:12:27.882 --> 00:12:29.649
I have a short neck and legs.

310
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:31.717
- I went to college with Hamurai. - Hai!

311
00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:33.820
I saved Ghost in a Jar's life in Vietnam.

312
00:12:33.822 --> 00:12:35.988
- Boo rah! - And, Beth, how many times

313
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.890
have I been a shoulder for you to cry on?

314
00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:39.759
Too many.

315
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:41.661
Okay, so maybe we're just all fake.

316
00:12:41.663 --> 00:12:43.062
That don't make no sense!

317
00:12:43.064 --> 00:12:45.231
Or maybe there's only one deceiver here--

318
00:12:45.233 --> 00:12:47.066
The person that keeps telling us

319
00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:49.502
the path to salvation is being held prisoner

320
00:12:49.504 --> 00:12:50.970
and mistrusting each other.

321
00:12:50.972 --> 00:12:52.305
Hey, don't blame me!

322
00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:53.906
I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!

323
00:12:53.908 --> 00:12:56.108
I know we all have beloved memories of Rick,

324
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.077
but are we really supposed to believe

325
00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.980
that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car

326
00:13:00.982 --> 00:13:04.517
just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?

327
00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:07.039
Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird,

328
00:13:07.064 --> 00:13:08.321
made-up sounding catchphrases.

329
00:13:08.423 --> 00:13:09.922
Wubba lubba dub dub!

330
00:13:09.924 --> 00:13:11.991
Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch!

331
00:13:11.993 --> 00:13:15.328
And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.

332
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.562
Hit the sack, Jack.

333
00:13:16.564 --> 00:13:18.364
Uh-oh! Somersault jump.

334
00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:19.832
AIDS!

335
00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:23.536
And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop!

336
00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:27.240
Grassss tastes bad-ah.

337
00:13:27.242 --> 00:13:28.941
No jumpin' in the sewer.

338
00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:29.942
Burger time!

339
00:13:29.944 --> 00:13:31.844
Rubber baby baby bunkers!

340
00:13:31.846 --> 00:13:34.013
Lick, lick, lick my balls!

341
00:13:34.015 --> 00:13:35.214
Yeah!

342
00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:36.549
Say that all the time.

343
00:13:37.852 --> 00:13:39.285
That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there.

344
00:13:39.287 --> 00:13:41.754
Yeah, don't forget his incredibly vague back story.

345
00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:43.356
Beth, I'm your father!

346
00:13:43.358 --> 00:13:44.624
Oh, are you, dad? Are you?

347
00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:46.259
Rick, if you want to prove you're real,

348
00:13:46.261 --> 00:13:48.628
just do what any of the rest of us would do and--

349
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.564
And-- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!

350
00:13:51.566 --> 00:13:54.867
Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy

351
00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:57.403
with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?

352
00:13:57.405 --> 00:13:58.771
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

353
00:13:58.773 --> 00:14:00.340
In your face!

354
00:14:00.342 --> 00:14:02.108
Give me the gun.

355
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.745
I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester.

356
00:14:05.747 --> 00:14:07.547
Bring him to the garage.

357
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.818
You listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum.

358
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.253
We could either do this the easy way or the hard way.

359
00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:15.721
You know, y-y-y-- Do you want to live?

360
00:14:15.723 --> 00:14:17.056
Then open the blast shield doors.

361
00:14:17.058 --> 00:14:18.991
Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd

362
00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:21.494
that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.

363
00:14:21.496 --> 00:14:23.095
You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us.

364
00:14:23.097 --> 00:14:24.997
You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.

365
00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:26.632
Oh, oh, oh, really?

366
00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:28.668
Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!

367
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.936
- Oh-- oh, yeah? - Yeah!

368
00:14:29.938 --> 00:14:31.504
I've got about a thousand memories

369
00:14:31.506 --> 00:14:34.006
of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant.

370
00:14:34.008 --> 00:14:35.641
The rest is annoying garbage.

371
00:14:35.643 --> 00:14:37.844
So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger?

372
00:14:37.846 --> 00:14:39.245
Do it! Do it, mother[bleep]!

373
00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:41.648
Pull the [bleep] trigger!

374
00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:44.684
Oh, wow.

375
00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:46.619
Baby wizard was a parasite?

376
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:48.488
He set me up with my wife.

377
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.423
What the hell?

378
00:14:50.425 --> 00:14:51.958
I figured it out, Rick!

379
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.793
The parasites can only create pleasant memories.

380
00:14:53.795 --> 00:14:57.830
I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!

381
00:14:57.932 --> 00:15:02.669
âª These memories that we have âª

382
00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:09.843
âª These memories that we cherish âª

383
00:15:10.445 --> 00:15:18.145
âª I wish that we can go back to that time âª

384
00:15:20.355 --> 00:15:22.555
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh âª

385
00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:24.657
Holy crap, Morty, you're right.

386
00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:27.459
Isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?

387
00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:31.698
Well, yeah, duh-doy. Took you long enough.

388
00:15:33.835 --> 00:15:35.334
Now let's go, Morty.

389
00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:37.670
We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate.

390
00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:43.543
Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.

391
00:15:43.545 --> 00:15:46.245
We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly.

392
00:15:46.247 --> 00:15:48.414
Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?

393
00:15:48.416 --> 00:15:51.484
I-I-- everyone has bad memories of me.

394
00:15:51.486 --> 00:15:53.419
You remember that one time?

395
00:15:57.425 --> 00:16:00.293
Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming.

396
00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:03.863
Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, Mrs. Refrigerator.

397
00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:05.364
They're thrilling.

398
00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:09.001
And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life.

399
00:16:09.003 --> 00:16:10.236
The jig is up!

400
00:16:10.238 --> 00:16:12.238
Get me out of here.

401
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.739
Get me out of here!

402
00:16:13.741 --> 00:16:15.241
Aah!

403
00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:17.009
Oh [bleep]!

404
00:16:17.011 --> 00:16:18.878
Everybody back! If you're not a parasite,

405
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.913
you have nothing to fear. So what about Summer?

406
00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:23.316
Why am I always your go-to?

407
00:16:26.287 --> 00:16:28.854
- Never go in my room again. - I didn't!

408
00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:30.189
She's real.

409
00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:32.359
She's my bitch of a sister.

410
00:16:32.383 --> 00:16:33.560
Nice.

411
00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:37.096
âª

412
00:16:37.098 --> 00:16:38.798
Mom, are you driving me to--

413
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.600
Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?

414
00:16:40.602 --> 00:16:41.968
Oh, my god. Are you drunk?

415
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.569
What are you?

416
00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:44.937
- My wife coach? - Your what?

417
00:16:44.939 --> 00:16:46.305
Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh.

418
00:16:46.307 --> 00:16:48.307
- Oh! God! Mom! - Sweetheart, are you okay?

419
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:50.270
- I didn't mean to-- - I'm gonna have a bruise!

420
00:16:50.295 --> 00:16:52.754
- It's picture day! - It's not-- don't overreact.

421
00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:54.046
I can clean it up.

422
00:16:54.048 --> 00:16:56.048
I want the police to take me!

423
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.950
Morty, give a gun to the lady

424
00:16:57.952 --> 00:17:00.119
that got pregnant with me too early

425
00:17:00.121 --> 00:17:02.421
and constantly makes it our problem.

426
00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:04.490
Thank you, sweetie.

427
00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:05.570
Beth, Beth, please!

428
00:17:05.595 --> 00:17:07.026
I thought it was too good to be true

429
00:17:07.028 --> 00:17:08.428
that we'd have compatible kidneys.

430
00:17:23.244 --> 00:17:24.343
Come on, man.

431
00:17:24.345 --> 00:17:26.078
Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence

432
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.847
or an awkward fart on a road trip?

433
00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.849
Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.

434
00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:31.183
Rick, I'm Pencilvester.

435
00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:33.419
Listen to that name. You can't kill me.

436
00:17:33.421 --> 00:17:35.488
You're right.

437
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.024
Kill Pencilvester.

438
00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:50.036
Summer, I've always loved you!

439
00:17:50.038 --> 00:17:52.238
Yep.

440
00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:10.823
- Oh, my god! - I thought you went to a concert!

441
00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:13.125
We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?!

442
00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:15.161
I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me!

443
00:18:15.163 --> 00:18:16.696
You're not the victim here!

444
00:18:16.698 --> 00:18:19.832
I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace!

445
00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:21.534
Aaaaaah!

446
00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:27.239
Ah. Master Rick.

447
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:29.842
Remember when you weren't going to shoot me?

448
00:18:31.179 --> 00:18:33.579
I guess I did the Butler! Ha ha!

449
00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:35.548
Does-- Does that scan?

450
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.882
Oh, I get it.

451
00:18:36.884 --> 00:18:39.351
It's a play on "The Butler did it."

452
00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:40.853
Thanks, Ghost in a Jar.

453
00:18:40.855 --> 00:18:44.091
You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.

454
00:18:48.229 --> 00:18:50.262
You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.

455
00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:52.064
Don't worry. I have a plan.

456
00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:54.533
If we can get to my boat, there's a--

457
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.269
No. No!

458
00:18:57.271 --> 00:19:01.173
Just send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary.

459
00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:02.875
Oh, god.

460
00:19:02.877 --> 00:19:04.276
Whoa. What the hell?

461
00:19:04.278 --> 00:19:06.245
Look out for that homeless guy!

462
00:19:06.247 --> 00:19:08.347
Open the door! Open the door!

463
00:19:08.349 --> 00:19:10.883
There isn't time! Just run!

464
00:19:10.885 --> 00:19:13.119
Get out here and help me!

465
00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:15.755
They say you shouldn't do that! Just run!

466
00:19:15.857 --> 00:19:18.724
Ugh. Sorry, Jerry. You're real.

467
00:19:18.726 --> 00:19:20.960
I'm a parasite!

468
00:19:20.962 --> 00:19:23.129
Yeah, but you're real.

469
00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:27.166
Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary.

470
00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:28.667
Me, too.

471
00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:33.572
From now on, let's all be careful

472
00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:36.242
to wash our hands when we get back from outer space.

473
00:19:36.244 --> 00:19:37.810
That goes for everyone.

474
00:19:37.812 --> 00:19:39.145
This is depressing.

475
00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:41.147
We killed every good person in the house.

476
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:43.149
We're what's left? What a family.

477
00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:44.817
At least we're real, Jerry.

478
00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:46.619
We're real. Ricky ticky tavi!

479
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:49.221
Ooh, whee! Amen to that.

480
00:19:49.223 --> 00:19:51.924
Now, this little Poopypants is hungry.

481
00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:53.926
Will somebody pass me a pork chop?

482
00:19:57.165 --> 00:19:58.164
Huh.

483
00:19:58.166 --> 00:20:00.332
Is-- is something wrong, Beth?

484
00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:01.333
Ow!

485
00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:02.434
Oh, my god!

486
00:20:02.436 --> 00:20:03.836
- No, Beth! - Oh [bleep]!

487
00:20:03.838 --> 00:20:05.504
Wait, but I--

488
00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:06.972
- Oh, Beth! Why?! - I need an ambulance!

489
00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:08.440
There's been a shooting. My wife shot...

490
00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:11.777
Uh, my-- my wife shot a long-time family friend.

491
00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:12.404
Why?

492
00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:14.280
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole.

493
00:20:14.282 --> 00:20:15.681
- I-I thought-- - Keep breathing!

494
00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:17.483
- Oh, god. What's happening? - Look at me!

495
00:20:17.485 --> 00:20:19.251
Look at me! Don't-- don't fall asleep!

496
00:20:19.253 --> 00:20:21.287
Is-- is this what bleeding to death is?

497
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:23.088
Oh, whee. Is this how I die?

498
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.290
Oh, geez! Oh, my god!

499
00:20:24.292 --> 00:20:25.925
Why would you do this, Beth?

500
00:20:25.927 --> 00:20:27.793
It's not supposed to hurt.

501
00:20:27.795 --> 00:20:29.795
I-I thought...

502
00:20:29.797 --> 00:20:31.030
Ooh, whee.

503
00:20:31.332 --> 00:20:35.234
âª

504
00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:09.235
Oh, he-- he's looking a lot better.

505
00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:12.004
Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself.

506
00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:14.206
I made a similar mistake years ago,

507
00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:16.475
but, you know, on a planetary scale.

508
00:21:16.477 --> 00:21:20.079
- Is, um, is he mad at me? - He's not pressing charges.

509
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:22.681
I mean, that's got to be the "you shot me" equivalent

510
00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:24.316
of not being mad.

511
00:21:24.318 --> 00:21:28.921
- Can he have visitors? - He'd like to be alone.

512
00:21:28.923 --> 00:21:32.024
He told me to tell you he's sorry

513
00:21:32.026 --> 00:21:34.159
you didn't have bad memories of him?

514
00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:38.530
If you love him, you should leave.

515
00:21:42.502 --> 00:21:45.938
And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.

516
00:21:47.341 --> 00:21:48.941
Did you get any of that?

517
00:21:48.943 --> 00:21:51.010
It's-a good show-a.
