1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.139
Morty, be sure to pee before we go.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.659
This adventure is gonna be a long haul,

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.439
and I don't feel like emptying the jug.

4
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.965
Jerry, will you please just let me automate this [BLEEP] task?

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.659
I didn't ask for anyone's help.

6
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.299
You two are welcome to leave.

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.759
Mom told me she wanted me to stay here

8
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.919
to make sure you didn't die.

9
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.499
Well, you tell your mother that I'm gonna be fine.

10
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.395
Don't train your child to lie, Jerry,

11
00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:20.109
even though, you know, 'tis the season.

12
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.909
Then I'll tell her. Whoa!

13
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.799
I told you, no more rays.

14
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.459
What ray did you zap me with?

15
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.359
I made your atomic matrix slightly lighter than air,

16
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.782
and now your shoes are heavier than air,

17
00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:33.399
which makes you neutrally buoyant,

18
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.339
which I find personally more impressive conceptually

19
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.199
than walking on water, but what do I know?

20
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.389
I wasn't born into the god business.

21
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.543
I [BLEEP] earned it.

22
00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:43.859
Whoa!

23
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.463
Just to be clear, this doesn't mean you helped me.

24
00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:47.639
It wears off in 10 hours,

25
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.599
and the next hit will cost you 30 bucks.

26
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.319
Like I'll even be using it in 10 hours.

27
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.269
Siri, set a 9-hour and 50-minute timer.

28
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.725
Playing The Beatles.

29
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.119
- I need to pee. - Nope.

30
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.819
Here, I've got a centipede you can swallow

31
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.899
that makes you not have to go.

32
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.519
I ain't swallowing no centipede.

33
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.560
What, you think the centipede wants to eat your pee?

34
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.349
You're not the victim in this transaction.

35
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.019
Uh-oh, flat tire.

36
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.160
How the hell do you get a flat tire in space, Rick?

37
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.519
Obviously from a sharp thing in space, Morty.

38
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.999
It's just crazy how much it feels

39
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.179
like getting a regular flat.

40
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.279
Oh, no, no, that's just my custom-programmed,

41
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940
fully immersive flat-tire indication experience.

42
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.149
I can turn it off. I thought it was cooler

43
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.479
than the celebrity voice package, but here.

44
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.169
Flat tire... you should be... walkin'.

45
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.199
- Oof. - Yeah.

46
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.674
- Can I come out with you, Rick? - No, I've seen this movie.

47
00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.560
Two guys leave th... e ship.

48
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.909
One guy goes spinning away.

49
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.579
You're staying in here where it's safe.

50
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.899
- Morty, goddamn it. - Come on.

51
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.439
I n... I never get to be out here.

52
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.319
Ugh, you young people think space is like

53
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.659
"Saturday Night Live."

54
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.179
You see it every day, so you dream of being in it,

55
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.559
but it dreams of removing all the air from your body

56
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.407
and making you float around it for eternity

57
00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:55.999
as a flash-mummified corpse,

58
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.069
which is also what space wants, so get back in the car.

59
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.119
I'm not in danger. There's nothing out here.

60
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.700
Literally everything is out here,

61
00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:05.126
and unlike everywhere else, I'm too busy to help you.

62
00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:07.549
Right, because you're always so helpful.

63
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.260
Ah!

64
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.959
- God damn it. - What is that?

65
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.659
Obviously, it's a space snake.

66
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.439
T-There's snakes in space?

67
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.759
There's literally everything in space, Morty!

68
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.934
Now get the [BLEEP] back in the car.

69
00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:54.799
I'm dying, Rick.

70
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.999
I can see the black mountain.

71
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.439
People who are really dying don't keep bring it up.

72
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.699
- Is that true? - I don't know.

73
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.939
I'm just usually around people that die faster.

74
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.979
All right. All right.

75
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.809
J-Just let me analyze the snake's planet,

76
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.273
so I can whip up an antivenom.

77
00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:10.339
Computer, you might want to put a rush on this.

78
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.859
Morty's starting to look like a '90s Japanese ghost.

79
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.659
Cutting corners.

80
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.179
Oof, oh, my God, these snakes are a mess.

81
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.899
19 billion snakes divided into 10,000 nations

82
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.419
all on the brink of global war over...

83
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.099
race.

84
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.199
How funny is that?

85
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.229
Imagine being a racist snake.

86
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.559
"Hey, other snake, I hate you

87
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.599
because you're the wrong color, snake."

88
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.119
Oh, my God. You're not laughing?

89
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.659
Oh, you're dying.

90
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.169
It's a miracle they were able to fling one this far out

91
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.899
before they slithered into extinction.

92
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.439
Oh, oh, God, I killed their...

93
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.739
What's his name, their Buzz Aspirin?

94
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.119
It's actually Buzz Advil, Morty,

95
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.579
and, uh, this is totally different.

96
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.659
It's a female snake.

97
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.249
There's an extra layer of heartbreak.

98
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.999
Wait. Wait. Morty, Morty, you hear that?

99
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.659
Listen.

100
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.589
Snake jazz.

101
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.030
Ha. Idiots. Let's get moving.

102
00:03:57.031 --> 00:03:59.241
We've got a long way to go, and I'm not sharing that centipede.

103
00:03:59.242 --> 00:04:00.439
Rick, wait. Go back.

104
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.599
I-I can't be the reason why 19 billion snakes lost all hope.

105
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.259
That's right, Morty. Only 19 billion snakes can do that.

106
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.669
That species was never getting beyond this stage.

107
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.939
To paraphrase the great Jeff Foxworthy,

108
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.160
if you bite your first contact on its ankle,

109
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.716
you might be a type-zero-civilization-neck."

110
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.359
What up, homeys?

111
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.845
Shooting hoops, I see.

112
00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:22.749
Hey, who's interested in a friendly bet

113
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.639
that this white guy can jump.

114
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.949
Hey, leave the racial stuff off the court, okay?

115
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.059
Oh, I thought that kind of talk was part of street ball.

116
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.819
Well, now it's part of everything else, so chill.

117
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.239
We... We got off on the wrong foot.

118
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.179
My name is Jerry Smith. I live in the suburbs.

119
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.159
I'm only here because I have a certain power

120
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.239
I wanted to kind of celebrate before it goes away.

121
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.979
Yo, we got a Nazi up here.

122
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.239
Hey, I think there's a misunderstanding.

123
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.999
Here, just... just watch.

124
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.160
Huh?

125
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.399
Help! Help!

126
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.208
I-I need that shoe!

127
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.719
No, no, don't touch that shoe or that money.

128
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.899
Let them be a powerful but confusing monument

129
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.379
to our neighborhood's integrity.

130
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.619
Oh, boy, what an adventure, huh?

131
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.669
Hey, Morty, listen. I can tell you're pretty upset

132
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.219
about the whole snake encounter thing,

133
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.459
so I'll tell you what.

134
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.719
I'm just gonna go ahead and avoid you

135
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.169
for the rest of the day.

136
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.529
Play snake jazz.

137
00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:27.246
I-Is this one friendly?

138
00:05:27.247 --> 00:05:28.399
It's a snake.

139
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.559
You ever... You ever see this one look up at the sky

140
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.779
like it's dreaming of something more?

141
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.019
No, but, uh, all those ones marked with red sticker, yeah.

142
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.999
Any snake over 50 bucks yearns for the beyond.

143
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.459
I-I-I've seen them do it.

144
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.620
Ow! Damn it, Slippy, come on.

145
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.740
Ow! Just please.

146
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.099
I'm sorry.

147
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.019
Everyone has a plumbus in their home.

148
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.817
First, they take the dinglepop.

149
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.320
Ow! [BLEEP] monster.

150
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.099
Downbeat.

151
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.460
How do you win this [BLEEP] game?

152
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.940
We-We've never gotten that far.

153
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.309
Guys, did I not tell you to keep your eye on Jerry?

154
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.759
- We did. - Then where is he?

155
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.219
Maybe he's having an affair.

156
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.999
But for real, has anyone seen him?

157
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.919
Grandpa, did you trap him in a painting again?

158
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.939
I didn't do shit.

159
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.059
Well, y-y-you made him floaty.

160
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.379
- Asshole. - Made him floaty?

161
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.619
I saved his life by making his body slightly lighter than air,

162
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.259
and it expires in a couple of hours.

163
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.659
Expires, like he'll fall out of the sky?

164
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.119
He won't by in the sky, Beth,

165
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.879
unless it's possible for Jerry to [BLEEP] up wearing shoes.

166
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.960
- Oh, crap, he's gonna die. - What were you thinking?

167
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.689
Hey, babe.

168
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.679
Jerry, are you in the air?

169
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.281
Rick told me he made you floaty.

170
00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:51.099
Made me floaty? Pfft.

171
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.559
Got to love Rick's world view.

172
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.699
Yes, I had Rick make me floaty

173
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.919
so I could put up some lights.

174
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.529
Now, I'm at the light store.

175
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.619
Get away!

176
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.669
Sorry, this lady at the store is trying to peck me.

177
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.279
Yes, you can help me find lights after I'm off the phone.

178
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.369
We're in Rick's ship. How about we just pick you up?

179
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.899
- You're with Rick? - Well, why wouldn't I...

180
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.499
Jerry, I paused Beth with a device

181
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.859
Christopher Walken gave me after a record session.

182
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.182
Real talk, buddy, where you at?

183
00:09:16.183 --> 00:09:18.019
- Go to hell, Rick. - Come on, Jerry.

184
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.659
I can recognize the sound of a seagull.

185
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.099
Can you recognize the sound of a man's pants

186
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.739
filling up with rain?

187
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.689
I hope to one day.

188
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.539
Jerry, I'll tell you what.

189
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.693
Because it's Christmas, I'm gonna do you a favor.

190
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.899
I won't let you die, and I won't tell Beth

191
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.949
that you almost killed yourself.

192
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.869
- Sounds like a win-win to me. - Come again?

193
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.279
If I survive, it'll be without you,

194
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.599
and if I die, it'll be on your ass.

195
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.599
Merry Christmas, bitch.

196
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.713
I am the Jesus Christ of Christmas!

197
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.319
... I be with him?

198
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.359
We both care.

199
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.499
- Whoa. Jerry. - Yes, honey?

200
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.029
Let us just come get you.

201
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.519
Beth, I am so touched

202
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.679
that you care for me this much, but I'm fine,

203
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.429
and I just want to put up these Christmas lights,

204
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.299
and I will eat your world.

205
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.579
Honey, my dad can hear you.

206
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.969
Got to go.

207
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.339
See you soon.

208
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.439
Okay.

209
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.659
Well, it sounds like he's fine.

210
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.212
Yeah, I'm almost kind of rooting for him this time.

211
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.379
One Diet Sprite Remix, please,

212
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.999
and, uh, is anyone here an Uber driver?

213
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.599
You can't bring that boulder in here.

214
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.379
- What? - I said no boulders.

215
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.119
- This ain't the lake, buddy. - Drop the rock.

216
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.320
Well, it's kind of a... a service boulder.

217
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.739
Yeah, I float without it.

218
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.799
Big man holding a big rock,

219
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.069
think you can take me down?

220
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.699
No, obviously not.

221
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.249
- You're huge. - Then put it down.

222
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.439
- Put the boulder down! - If I put it down,

223
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.679
- I'm going to float. - Drop it!

224
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.019
- Put it down! - And frankly, your bar

225
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.029
has a lot of ceiling fans.

226
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.499
- You think you're better than us? - Drop the rock.

227
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.619
- Put it down. - Okay, okay, okay.

228
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.799
Hey, whoa, what the [BLEEP].

229
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.519
- Stop doing that. - I told you this would happen.

230
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.539
- Well, stop floating. - Who said you could float here?

231
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.219
I can't control it.

232
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.489
Aaaaaaaaaah!

233
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.629
And take your girlfriend with you.

234
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.759
Summer, how supes shook am I

235
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.499
about your playlisting fleekness tonight?

236
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.147
You love it? It's snake jazz.

237
00:11:28.148 --> 00:11:30.109
My little brother got bit by a snake in outer space

238
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.260
and killed it with a hubcap,

239
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.959
and my grandpa had to scan its planet's culture

240
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.639
for an antivenom, and they found this.

241
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.959
It's my jam.

242
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.299
Seriously, my new thing now is snake jazz.

243
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.519
Can you alter the course of a species' evolution like that

244
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.529
without repercussions?

245
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:43.940
Gee, I don't know, Nancy.

246
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.320
Can you alter the course of being a giant [BLEEP] nerd?

247
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.679
- Sorry. - Also, later,

248
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.599
we need to discuss your clothing and your weight.

249
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.620
That's fair.

250
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.709
What the hell?

251
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.099
Target acquired.

252
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.399
Snakes! Get back in the car!

253
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.919
Morty, enough with the... Snakes!

254
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.021
Target acquired.

255
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.119
Aliens, I am a robot sent back in time

256
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.279
by the Snake Resistance

257
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.902
to protect you from Serpacorp.

258
00:12:14.903 --> 00:12:16.980
My appearance is designed to be familiar

259
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.031
and to put you at ease.

260
00:12:18.032 --> 00:12:21.399
The ape child must be eliminated to protect our timeline.

261
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.911
Morty, what the hell did you do?

262
00:12:22.912 --> 00:12:24.819
I was just trying to do the right thing.

263
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.159
I took a living snake...

264
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.869
- Get behind me. I will protect... - Aaah!

265
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.379
Why... Why are they attacking us?

266
00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.579
I-I-I helped them.

267
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.299
You gave them proof that there was something bigger

268
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.419
and scarier to unite against, you little idiot.

269
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.899
They would have gone back into the Dark Ages

270
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.179
for a couple of generations,

271
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.849
but instead, they dedicated themselves

272
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.319
into making universe-destroying,

273
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.719
un-thought-out technology like time travel

274
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.319
all so they could try to kill a little [BLEEP] sack on Earth

275
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.779
who couldn't let a dead snake be dead

276
00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.759
even after it bit his ankle.

277
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.520
Next time, stay in the [BLEEP] car.

278
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.369
17 billion snake lives ended on June 21, 2026.

279
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.579
The survivors lived only to face a new nightmare,

280
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.039
- the war between snake and machine. - _

281
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.219
In the end, snake overcame machine

282
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.189
because of what we couldn't predict...

283
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.659
that an alien, a child from a distant star, would save us.

284
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.519
_

285
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.409
W-Where are we going? W-What are we doing here, Rick?

286
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.701
We got to get the heart of Snake Net.

287
00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:46.202
Now, shut up, and stay close.

288
00:13:46.203 --> 00:13:48.662
Resistance is mouselike.

289
00:13:48.663 --> 00:13:50.939
Whoa, hey, look. That one's actually really cool.

290
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.020
Come here, little guy.

291
00:13:52.021 --> 00:13:53.949
Ah, you little son of a bitch.

292
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.628
Come on, Morty.

293
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:59.382
Your brood must be exterminated.

294
00:13:59.383 --> 00:14:01.889
You will not kill her or her brood.

295
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.669
- Must kill brood and mother. - Get behind me.

296
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.829
Your brood will seed all life on this planet.

297
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.558
- That doesn't make sense. - That didn't make sense.

298
00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:10.499
Hey, it's... it's Slippy!

299
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.270
Keep up, shit bag.

300
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.499
Hi, you went directly to voicemail

301
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.859
because your number is not in my phone.

302
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.249
Don't leave a message.

303
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.719
Hi, honey.

304
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.639
Uh, look. Morty told me that you didn't think

305
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.460
I could hang lights without killing myself.

306
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.929
Look, I want to be a strong man for you, but the truth is...

307
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.890
The truth is, I'm coming home with the best lights ever.

308
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.759
Oof.

309
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.399
Whoa, feel that turbulence?

310
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.799
Nope, I'm on molly.

311
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.605
Give me some. Ahh.

312
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.760
Aaaah!

313
00:15:05.282 --> 00:15:07.032
I don't suppose you guys will take a bribe?

314
00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.940
Ah!

315
00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:14.550
Anyone else want legs?

316
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.539
God damn it. Are you kidding me?

317
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.339
I thought there'd be a time machine in here.

318
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.499
They're not even a quarter of the way through making it.

319
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.969
I'm gonna have to invent it for them.

320
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.649
I-I don't know snake math.

321
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.419
Ugh, I didn't want to have to do this.

322
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.979
[BLEEP] All right.

323
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.999
W-What's going on? What are you doing?

324
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.396
I'm reminding myself to commit even more to your [BLEEP] up.

325
00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:38.399
Hey, assholes.

326
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.789
[BLEEP] you. Takes one to know one.

327
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.059
What the heck?

328
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.519
- Hey, man, you... you okay? - You know what? [BLEEP] you.

329
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.859
- What? Screw you. - Here.

330
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.249
Come on. Was it really that hard?

331
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.160
What do you think? Come on, Morty.

332
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.179
Man, I-I-I wonder why I had a black eye.

333
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.120
Morty, shut the [BLEEP] up and put these on.

334
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.820
_

335
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.549
Okay, so w-what are we doing?

336
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.949
That book has everything they need

337
00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.419
to create snake time travel,

338
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.379
a-and they're getting it in 1985, snake time.

339
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.859
Now, they're gonna do it so early that it won't involve us,

340
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.351
and they're gonna be even stupider with it.

341
00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:15.759
Huh, a-and then what?

342
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.539
We're removing ourselves from this sloppy,

343
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.579
[BLEEP] up story and letting snake time travel

344
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.150
eat its own tail.

345
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.100
_

346
00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.729
_

347
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.519
Just have to keep my grip.

348
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.019
Jerry Smith, I am here to save you.

349
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.519
What? I already told Rick I don't want help.

350
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.839
I do not know Rick.

351
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.239
I was sent by a society of human-snake hybrids...

352
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.200
- Classic Rick. - ... from an alternate version...

353
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.180
I did it! We're landing!

354
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.719
I knew I could do it.

355
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.979
Jesus Christ, Rick, it's pandemonium out there!

356
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.919
T-This is worse than when we left.

357
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.950
Rick, look, Summer!

358
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.589
Nobody chokes me without consent.

359
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.459
Y-You just made things worse, Rick.

360
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.199
Trust me, Morty. We helped them press on the gas pedal.

361
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.517
We just got to wait for them to blow by a cop.

362
00:18:19.518 --> 00:18:21.769
_

363
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.499
Shleemypants here, what's up?

364
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.489
Snakes? Time travel? They did what?

365
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.599
How the [BLEEP] did... Okay, okay, I'm on it.

366
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.320
We got a 10-51 on a goddamn snake planet.

367
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.479
Don't look at me. I'm afraid of snakes.

368
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.239
"I'm afraid of snakes," [BLEEP].

369
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.159
You afraid of work. That's what you afraid of.

370
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.460
All right. All right.

371
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.900
Let's go take care of this.

372
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.799
Oh, look at you.

373
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.319
You a smart snake, huh?

374
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.239
You using tools now, huh?

375
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.540
Those tools are gonna turn into you

376
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.359
manipulating the fabric of shit.

377
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.059
- Get over here, mother[BLEEP]. - What the [BLEEP] you think you doing?

378
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.810
- Don't [BLEEP] with time. - You don't [BLEEP] with time.

379
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.229
Holy [BLEEP].

380
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.239
What happened?

381
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.199
Look, this is better than them attacking us.

382
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.799
Also, that's about as much curvature

383
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.278
as you're gonna get from a time-travel story.

384
00:19:12.279 --> 00:19:15.139
You know what? This one counts as one of your adventures.

385
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.499
- Hey, come on. - No freebies.

386
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.559
Aw, man, I-I wanted to go to Boob World.

387
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.609
Well, now, we can't because you [BLEEP] up.

388
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.399
Got to learn a lesson.

389
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.039
You want to go to Boob World, Summer?

390
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.619
Eh, not today.

391
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.019
This sucks.

392
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.219
Hey, honey, check it out.

393
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.259
Jerry, I was worried about you.

394
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.659
Oh, just killing some snakes up here like everyone else,

395
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.880
I guess, and finishing the Christmas lights.

396
00:19:37.887 --> 00:19:40.184
Wait, the whole time? I was screaming for help,

397
00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:41.348
and you stayed on the roof?

398
00:19:41.349 --> 00:19:43.639
I couldn't hear you over my own screaming.

399
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.810
We've talked about this.

400
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:46.645
Well, I'm just glad you're safe.

401
00:19:46.646 --> 00:19:49.639
Well, duh, of course, I'm safe.

402
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.109
Hey, guess what, asshole.

403
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.309
I did it without you.

404
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.819
Whoa! Ah!

405
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.579
Oh, God, it hurts.

406
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.849
What was that?

407
00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.620
I healed your leg 50%.

408
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.679
The rest is on you, big man.

409
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.659
That's what I'm talking about. Respect, my brother.

410
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.879
Geez, your dad sucks. All right, Morty.

411
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.002
Let's go enjoy a little bit of eggnog, huh?

412
00:20:09.003 --> 00:20:11.399
- All right. - Not so fast, boys.

413
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.259
Yeah, I think you might be forgetting something.

414
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.006
Merry Christmas, [BLEEP] nuts. Get to work.

415
00:20:15.007 --> 00:20:16.799
Geez, I don't see why you have to be smug about it.

416
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.259
- A bunch of [BLEEP]. - That's not necessary.

417
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.299
- This [BLEEP] sucks. - Yeah, it's fun until it's you,

418
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.039
- huh, shit nog? - Yeah, have fun sewing

419
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.599
those snake costumes together,

420
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.419
- you little tramp. - You tell them, Morty.

421
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.359
Geez, you guys don't have to be dicks about it, all right?

422
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.959
Yeah, neither did the guys before us,

423
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.099
but you know what? They were.

424
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.499
- Merry Christmas, you shit bags. - Yeah, ghost of Christmas future,

425
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.049
bitches, you [BLEEP] idiots.

426
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.569
- So mean. - Those guys are mean.

427
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.959
Man, I just want to open my Christmas presents.

428
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.279
Well, I'm waiting on you to finish those snake costumes.

429
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.819
I'm almost done. You know what?

430
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.599
T-They're good enough. I'm done.

431
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.612
All right. Let's go.

432
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.572
All right. We're landing. Come on.

433
00:21:20.573 --> 00:21:22.620
Man, I can't believe we're almost done, Rick.

434
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.493
I can practically taste the eggnog.

435
00:21:24.494 --> 00:21:25.869
Hey, you know what?

436
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.959
I... I feel like we're forgetting something.

437
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.009
Oh, yeah, uh, thanks for reminding me.

438
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.279
Morty, next time, stay in the car.

439
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.462
